The available sites for reservoirs to hold surface run-off had already been exploited and it became clear that piping water from the River Murray would be the most significant means to increase water supply to settled areas for the future.</p> <p>Construction began on the Mannum-Adelaide Pipeline in 1951 and by 1955 the line was supplying water to Adelaide. This film footage showing scenes of the construction of the Mannum-Adelaide Pipeline in the early 1950s was taken by amateur filmmaker Ron Axer. Axer, a returned service-man and newsagent in Mannum, recorded many local River scenes and events between 1950 and 1974.</p> </div></div>",,-34.91,139.3,Film,,Mannum,,1946-1979,NULL

Although construction of the bridge began in October 1993 it was soon halted in response to protests. In early 1994 objection to the bridge construction suggested the site for the bridge was sacred and related to sacred women's business for the local Ngarrindjeri women. Protests, legal action and emergency declarations under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act of 1984, led to the first report, the Saunder's Report, finding that Ngarrindjeri women considered the area crucial for the Ngarrindjeri people. On 8 July 1994 Minister Tickner issued a declaration protecting the proposed site for 25 years.

It was 8 April 1802. He had completed his exploration of Saint Vincent Gulf, re-provisioned and filled his water casks on Kangaroo Island and began to follow the coast to the south-east. Two ships in previously unexplored waters faced each other anxiously: their countries were at war. It was possible that the flags of truce might be dishonoured, so both captains were cautious. Flinders was aware that the French were exploring these waters, but the French captain did not know about Flinders's expedition which had left England after the French had sailed.</p> <p>Matthew Flinders sailed from Portsmouth in HMS <em>Investigator</em> on 18 July 1801 to explore New Holland's (Australia's) unknown southern coast. By 27 January 1802, the <em>Investigator</em> was near the head of the Great Australian Bight. From February to March 1802, the British crew surveyed Spencer Gulf, explored Kangaroo Island, and charted Saint Vincent Gulf. In April the <em>Investigator</em> revisited Kangaroo Island, and on April 8 and 9, unexpectedly met the French expedition under the command of Nicolas Baudin at the location which became known as Encounter Bay. Despite their countries being at war, the captains exchanged information in a spirit of cooperation. Flinders continued to journey eastwards, leaving present day South Australian waters on 19 April, and reaching Port Jackson in May 1802. After the <em>Investigator</em> had been refitted and the crew rested, the English expedition sailed north to survey the eastern coast of the continent, adding to James Cook's earlier charts, and then chart the Gulf of Carpentaria.</p> <p>The pressing need for further ship repairs forced Flinders to sail to Timor. He stopped his survey of the north Australian coastline at Wessel Islands. The <em>Investigator</em> then continued on around the western and southern coasts of New Holland, arriving back in Port Jackson [Sydney] in June 1803, thereby completing the circumnavigation. The <em>Investigator</em> was deemed unseaworthy, so Flinders sailed in the <em>Porpoise</em> to return to England, only to be shipwrecked at Wreck Reef. Using the <em>Porpoise</em>'s cutter, Flinders returned to Port Jackson and arranged the rescue of the crew. In a second attempt to return home, Flinders set out on the <em>Cumberland</em>, but as this ship required repair, he was forced to seek assistance at Ile de France [Mauritius].</p> <p>France and England had resumed war, and the Governor General of Ile de France detained Flinders for the next 6 years. During this period Flinders prepared his charts and in a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, championed the name 'Australia' for the entire southern continent, rather than 'Terra Australis' or 'New Holland'. Flinders finally gained his freedom, leaving Ile de France in June 1810 and arriving back in England in October of that year. His account of the expedition <em>A voyage to Terra Australis</em>, with <em>Atlas</em>, was published on 18 July 1814.

Flinders also offered his passport from the French government but Baudin ignored it. He told Flinders of his expedition's work in Tasmania and his explorations along the southern coast from Western Port to the current place of meeting.</p> <p>He also mentioned that one of his ship's boats with its crew had been lost, and he had also become separated from his companion ship <em>Le Naturaliste</em>, during a storm. Baudin was somewhat critical of George Bass's map of Bass Strait until Flinders explained that his friend Bass had charted the coast from an open boat, which was noted on the chart. Flinders promised to return the next day with more charts for Baudin.</p> When he reached Port Jackson (Sydney) in May, Baudin learned that his ship's boat and its crew had been rescued and brought safely to the settlement. <em>Le Naturaliste</em> arrived safely in port soon after Baudin. The French expedition under Nicolas Baudin had set out to explore and chart the coastline of the 'unknown southern land', and make scientific observations. They were also looking for new land and trade opportunities. <em>Le Geographe</em> neared Cape Leeuwin on 27 May 1801, but then following instructions given in France, proceeded up the western coast to the north, reaching Timor in August. <em>Le Naturaliste</em> was separated from <em>Le Geographe</em> and travelled independently to Timor, charting the western coast in more detail. After a sojourn in Timor, the ships sailed south to Van Diemen's Land [Tasmania] by January 1802. Baudin explored the island extensively, and after surveying D'Entrecasteaux Channel, reached the mainland southern coast which he explored in a westward direction from Wilson's Promontory. The detailed surveys undertaken along the western coast of Australia and in Van Diemen's Land delayed Baudin's arrival on the 'unknown coast' where Flinders had already arrived from the west.</div> <div> <p>Winter was spent at Port Jackson, and then Baudin returned to the southern coast for a more thorough survey. <em>Le Naturaliste</em> was sent back to France with its scientific collections, and was replaced with <em>Le Casuarina</em>.

Even the smallest island discovered by Flinders has been usurped as a French discovery. Flinders adds as an extended footnote a passage from Peron's account.</p> There had been indignation in London when the French account was published, and a review in <em>Quarterly Review</em> was particularly scathing of the French usurpation of Flinders's discoveries. Flinders had been detained for six and half long years on Mauritius on his return to England to try and obtain a more seaworthy vessel than the leaking rotten <em>Investigator</em>. This delayed the publication of his account. However a second edition of the French account was published in 1824 and restitution was made with all of Flinders' discoveries, which had occurred prior to the historic meeting at Encounter Bay, being returned to the map.

The French at this time accepted Flinders's prior discovery of the majority of the South Australian coastline. Flinders includes an extract from the French account.</p> Captain Nicolas Baudin died on Mauritius in 1803 on the voyage home to France. As a result the account of the expedition was written by Francois Peron, who contrived to write the entire account without reference to Baudin, who was extremely unpopular with the officers and scientists aboard his ship. Perhaps if Baudin had lived to write the account matters may have been different. Peron himself died in 1810, and Louis Freycinet continued the second volume of the account.

However, when the French charts were published in 1811 the entire coastline from Westernport (Victoria) to Fowler Bay was dotted with French names, thereby denying Flinders' discoveries. He believes that Francois Peron who wrote the account of the expedition may have been directed by a higher authority to claim discovery of Terre Napoleon. Flinders considers it was a case of international political rivalry.</p> Some of the French officers believed that if they had not spent so long in Tasmania (Van Diemen's Land) making botanical, zoological and ethnographic collections, all of which were and continue to be very important pre-settlement records, that they would have beaten Flinders to his discoveries along the southern coastline of Australia. The French did in 1824 issue a second edition of the account of that expedition and restored Flinders's names to the stretch of coast he first discovered.

The pressing need for further ship repairs forced Flinders to sail to Timor. He stopped his survey of the north Australian coastline at Wessel Islands.

Golfe Josephine and Golfe Bonaparte were restored to Flinders' names of Gulf Saint Vincent and Gulf Spencer, and Ile Decres to Kangaroo Island. Some French names remain on those sections of the South Australian coast which the French discovered first, notably in the South East of the state and the southern coast of Kangaroo Island.

Nicolas Baudin died on the return voyage to France, so Francois Peron's wrote the report of the French expedition to Terres Australes. It is almost certain that Peron was responsible for the naming of many South Australian features after French scientists, artists and members of the expedition, including himself. Louis de Freycinet drew up the charts and maps of the expedition. Baudin had been discredited by both early deserters of the expedition and the returning travellers, and French authorities were embarrassed by the apparent failure of the voyage. Freycinet bestowed his own choice of place names to South Australian locations, disregarding names that Baudin had recorded earlier.

The second of this series of coastal profiles shows Cape Catastrophe, with Williams Island to the south. This cape was named for the accident that occurred here when the lives of the ship's master John Thistle and seven other seamen were lost. The nearby islands were named for the seamen lost with him when their cutter overturned in the dangerous tidal eddies off the cape. Thistle Island is the third profile. The dramatic peaks of the Flinders Ranges are the fourth profile. Flinders named only Mount Arden and Mount Brown. Kangaroo Island's Kangaroo Head forms the fifth profile on the sheet: this is near modern day Penneshaw. Cape Jervis is the final coastal profile for South Australia. In the days before photography the depiction of newly discovered coasts in coastal profiles was a valuable aid for later navigators on these coasts and enabled them to determine with greater accuracy where they were.</p> <p>William Westall was still a student at the Royal Academy when he was selected as the landscape artist for the Flinders' voyage of discovery. At nineteen years of age, he was the youngest member of the scientific staff on the <em>Investigator</em>. Westall was born on 12 October 1781 at Hertford in England, and was taught drawing by his elder half-brother, an established and successful artist and teacher. It was expected that as the landscape artist to the expedition, Westall would paint landscapes and figures that would clearly delineate Australia and its inhabitants. He was responsible also for recording the coastal profiles that would benefit later navigators. Westall's output for the southern Australian leg of the voyage was not as rich as might be expected for an artist on the 'unknown coast'. It has been said that he was not inspired by the drab Australian bush, and this can be seen in his sketches, which he frequently merged to produce something more picturesque. He certainly produced a greater body of work on the eastern and northern coasts. When Flinders returned to England aboard the <em>Porpoise</em>, Westall returned with him, and some of his work was damaged in the wreck off the coast of Queensland. Westall decided to continue his return to England via China, while his drawings were taken on to England. He returned to England in 1805, prepared a painting for a Royal Academy exhibition, and later travelled to Madeira and Jamaica. He painted nine pictures for reproduction in Flinders' <em>Voyage to Terra Australis</em> (1814). In his later life, he exhibited his work from time to time, but was never a successful artist.

In 1798 he and George Bass had surveyed parts of the southern New South Wales coastline and in 1798/9 he and Bass had circumnavigated Tasmania and proved it an island. These discoveries are reflected in Flinders's chart. Flinders stopped his detailed survey of the Australian coast at the north eastern shore of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory because of the leaking condition of his ship <em>Investigator</em>. He intended to return with another ship and complete his survey but this never happened. His charts were finally published in 1814.</p> <p>Flinders wanted to name the newly defined continent 'Australia', and had used the name as early as 1804, calling his draft of his chart 'General chart of Australia or Terra Australis'. This draft was drawn up while he was detained on Mauritius by the French, and was forwarded to Sir Joseph Banks in London, with a covering letter in which he asked that his suggestion of the name of Australia be submitted to the Admiralty and 'the learned in geography' for approval. The use of the name was not approved at that time, and 10 years later, the map was published in the atlas that accompanied <em>A Voyage to Terra Australis ....</em> as 'General chart of Terra Australis or Australia'.</p> <p>Flinders was not the first to use the name Australia for the continent of New Holland/New South Wales. The name had been used as early as 1625 by Samuel Purchas, and was actually a misprint for Austrialia del Espiritu Santo the name given by Fernandez de Quiros to the New Hebrides islands. He believed he had discovered a continent and named it for King Philip III of Spain, Archduke of Austria. The name Australia was used in other guises for the next 100 years or so, but was only specifically applied to Australia in 1794 by George Shaw in his book <em>Zoology of New Holland</em>. He writes of the 'vast island or rather continent of Australia, Australasia, or New Holland...'. Flinders may not have been the first to use the name, but he popularised it and Governor Lachlan Macquarie used the name and it was in common usage by the 1820s.</p> </div></div>",,-28.61,137.13,Book,Libraries Board of South Australia,Adelaide,Libraries Board of South Australia G. &amp; W.

His expedition crossed the desert in 25 days with a party of nine, pioneering the use of mobile radio communication, and making extensive zoological and botanical collections, which included 14 new species of spiders. The geology of the desert was also recorded. This was the first scientific examination of the Simpson Desert and only the second complete crossing by a European. Madigan's expedition was financed by AA Simpson of Adelaide, and was timed to take advantage of two good seasons of rain. Madigan was not the first to attempt a crossing of this desert. Before him there had been David Lindsay who had skirted it in the 1880s, Augustus Poeppel who was surveying the South Australian border in 1880, and in 1936 Ted Colson had crossed the desert from west to east, from his station at Blood Creek to Birdsville.

The <em>South Australia Act</em> was passed by the British Government in 1834. Before development of the new province could proceed, the Colonization Commissioners required sales of land to the value of 35,000 pounds, but the fixed price of land at 20 shillings per acre resulted in limited land sales.</p> <p>The South Australian Company was formed in London on 9 October 1835 to encourage the preliminary purchase of land in South Australia. George Fife Angas, Thomas Smith and Henry Kingscote formed a joint stock company to purchase the unsold land at 12 shillings per acre, and bought more than 13,000 acres, including prime town and country sections. On 27 June 1836 the Deed of settlement was signed by Angas, Smith, Kingscote and about 300 shareholders of the South Australian Company including John Rundle, Charles Hindley, Raikes Currie, John Pirie and Henry Waymouth.</p> <p>In January 1836 Angas equipped and despatched to South Australia an expedition of four ships on behalf of the company, ahead of the arrival of Colonel William Light and Governor John Hindmarsh in the province. A small settlement was established at Kingscote on Kangaroo Island in July 1836, but the location was unsuitable for farming, and the company's operations were soon transferred to the mainland, where Governor Hindmarsh arrived on 28 December 1836.</p> <p>In the new colony, the South Australian Company provided roads, bridges, ports, warehouses and mills, and established agriculture, whaling, banking and mining enterprises. The South Australian Company continued to play an influential role in the commercial affairs of Adelaide and rural regions for more than a century, with the company winding up on 17 March 1949 and the management of its affairs transferred to Elders Trustee.</p> <p>Due to its enormous significance to the Foundation of South Australia, the <em>Deed of Settlement</em> was submitted and accepted into the <a href=http://www.amw.org.au/index.html>UNESCO Australian Memory of the World program</a> in 2004.</p> </div></div>",,-29.38,135.86,Manuscript,,London,,"Pre-1836,1836-1851",NULL

He proposes an expedition to search the interior.</p> <p>Banks commences his letter by discussing the plant cabin that will be placed aboard HMS <em>Porpoise</em> to transplant living plants to Port Jackson. Among the plants to be taken out are hop plants for the brewing of beer, an attempt to wean the convicts and settlers away from hard spirits.</p> <p>However the most important matter to Banks in this letter is the question of the further exploration of Australia. To date (ie 1798) in New South Wales no large rivers, such as exist in Europe or America, had been found. Banks finds it difficult to believe that a country as large as Australia does not appear to have large rivers. He considers it a challenge that needs to be followed up, and suggests the noted African explorer Mungo Park.</p> Sir Joseph Banks had accompanied Captain James Cook on the voyage of discovery of 1768 that resulted in the charting of the east coast of Australia. After his return to England in 1771 he became an authority on the southern continent, particularly so after his election as President of the Royal Society in 1778. In 1779 he had recommended Botany Bay as the site for a penal colony. He was a great supporter of the colony of New South Wales when it was finally settled in 1788 and sent out collectors to continue the search for plant specimens. He also supported explorers such as Matthew Flinders.

He is also 'very moderate in his terms' and the conditions of his employment. Further says Banks, Matthew Flinders would be happy to serve under him.</p> <p>Banks then describes the type of vessel that should be used and the size of the crew. Banks would of course supply the instructions for the expedition. Mungo Park did not take up this proposal, and drowned in Africa in 1806. Matthew Flinders with his friend George Bass made a number of small boat voyages along the eastern coast of Australia, and also circumnavigated Tasmania proving it to be an island in 1798-99.

Von Mueller arrived in South Australia in December 1847, where he worked as a chemist, and made plant collections in his free time. He moved to Victoria in 1852 with an appointment as government botanist. In the course of this work he travelled extensively in Victoria, notably in the Murray Mallee, the Alps and the Grampians. His achievements as a botanist were astounding and he left little for later botanists to discover. He wrote over 800 papers and major works on Australian botany, as well as maintaining an extensive correspondence. He was the naturalist on Augustus Gregory's 1856 North Australia Expedition, and maintained an interest in Australian exploration, including sponsoring a number of expeditions, throughout his life.</p> <p>He served on the committee of the Royal Society of Victoria which organised the Burke and Wills expedition, and in 1865 urged the ladies of Australia to fund a search for the long-lost Ludwig Leichhardt. In the 1870s he sponsored Ernest Giles on a series of expeditions, also providing practical training to William Tietkens as botanist with Giles. Mueller's private sponsorship of these expeditions encouraged interest by the South Australian government which sent out several expeditions of its own at this time.</p> <p>Mueller was President of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science; the Mueller Memorial Medal for eminent scientific research is awarded by this organisation. He was a founding member of the Geographical Society of Australasia (Victorian Branch) and urged the establishment of a branch in South Australia. When the exploration of Australia seemed complete Ferdinand von Mueller encouraged the exploration of New Guinea, the Pacific Islands and the Antarctic.

There were many islands on Australia's north-west coast: perhaps they hid good harbours or the mouth of a great river. At this early stage of Australia's discovery and exploration, with large sections of coastline still uncharted, or only roughly charted, there was still room for considerable speculation. The totally unknown stretch of coast between the Nuyts Archipelago in South Australia (discovered in 1627) and Westernport in Victoria (discovered in 1798) held endless possibilities.</p> <p>Matthew Flinders would be the first to sail and chart this unknown southern section of the Australian coast.

Captain James Cook had navigated a passage through the strait in 1770, and William Bligh in 1789 in the ship's cutter after he was cast adrift by the mutineers of the Bounty. These however had been the only recorded passages through the strait, which was notorious for the islands, reefs and shoals throughout its length and breadth. Flinders was to examine it thoroughly to determine if it was a useful shortcut to India and the East Indies from Sydney.</p> <p>He was also to search for and chart the Trial Rocks, somewhere off the north-west coast of Australia. The English ship <em>Trial</em> had been wrecked there in 1622 and the rocks had not been found since.

Walcot also suggested that a shoulder gun should be used for firing a line when it was too difficult to get a line aboard from the shore because of reefs. He also recommended a lifeboat be stationed at Hog Bay (Penneshaw) on Kangaroo Island. Reports of the individual stations follow Walcot's summary.</p>  <p>The lifeboat service had been established fairly rapidly following the wreck of the Admella on the southeast coast in 1859.

However, following the wreck of the Star of Greece at Port Willunga in 1888, when 11 seamen lost their lives partly because of delays in getting the rocket equipment to the site, an overhaul of the lifeboat service was made. As a result, the South Australian Navy, in the form of Commander John Walcot of HMCS Protector, was placed in charge of the lifesaving service.

The inset vignettes include a view of Adelaide with Aboriginals in the foreground, a dingo or Australian dog, a nymphicus (parrot), natives on a catamaran and the Seal of South Australia.</p>  <p>This map was originally a plate within Tallis's <em>The illustrated atlas and modern history of the world geographical, political, commercial and statistical,</em> which includes text by R.

First published in 1850-1851 and issued several times during the 1850s, the atlas consists of eighty maps of all parts of the world and was originally sold in parts at 1 shilling or 25 cents. The maps were engraved on steel by the gifted artist and engraver John Rapkin.</p>  <p>The use of vignette of views, wildlife and inhabitants of the country and of decorative framing is a distinctive feature of Tallis maps. Most commonly Tallis maps were published with only a limited amount of colour, usually outlining boundaries and topographic features. However, many owners of Tallis atlases eventually commissioned colourists to tint the vignettes. In some cases, modern colouring has also been added to the original engravings.</p>  <p>The State Library holds three variations of colouring for the Tallis map of South Australia. The hand colouring of the map on display varies for the other copies held in that the coastline is outlined in blue, rather than the more usual red outlining, and the mining districts are not marked with red dots.</p>  <p>John Tallis's illustrated atlas is considered to be one of the last decorative atlases and Tallis maps, now most commonly sold as separate map sheets from debound atlases, are popular collector's items.</p>  <h3><em>Part of South Australia</em>: historical significance</h3>  <p>Records colony of South Australia in 1851:</p>  <ul>  <li>almost 50 years after Matthew Flinders and Nicholas Baudin first charted the southern coast in 1802</li>  <li>15 years after proclamation of the colony of South Australia in 1836</li>  <li>highlights explorer Edward John Eyre's 1840 expedition north to the interior of Australia, and attempt to find an overland route between the settlements of South Australia and Swan River on Australia's western coast.</li>  <li>Early counties of the colony are outlined eg Stanley, Gawler, Light, Eyre, Adelaide, Sturt, Hindmarsh, Russell</li>  <li>relief - indicating gradients - shown by hachures or line shadings</li>  <li>includes notes about the country and vegetation, indicating the harsh environment eg: 'stony and barren plains', 'dense brush' , 'barren country with salt lakes'.</li>  <li>South Australia's population in 1851: 63,700: almost one quarter of the European population lived in City of Adelaide, and another quarter on the Adelaide Plains; the other large settlements were the copper mining centres</li>  <li>Mining Districts (marked with red dots): crucial role in development of the colony:</li>  <li>1841: Australia's first metal mine with silver and lead at Wheal Gawler at Glen Osmond - produced Australia's first mineral exports</li>  <li>from 1840s: copper mining successes at Kapunda and Burra (Burra Burra)</li>  <li>by 1850 South Australia was one of the world's major copper producers, and copper comprised two-thirds of the total value of its exports.</li>  </ul>  </div></div>",,-29.38,135.86,Map,John Tallis &amp; Coy,London; NewYork,"Rogers, J; Warren, H; Tallis, John",1836-1851,NULL

Port Adelaide had long outgrown the requirements of the large mail steamships of the late 19th century. These moored off Semaphore Jetty and passengers were then transferred to launches to be taken to the jetty. In instances of rough weather this could be a hazardous situation, and many passengers declined the option and chose to remain on board. A number of schemes for an alternative harbor were proposed over the years, and many were as quickly dropped as unachievable. In 1901 a plan was submitted by Lindon Bates which with modifications was finally accepted and the <a href=/www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au/record=b11865544>Act of the South Australian Parliament</a> no. 765 of 1901 was passed. Tenders were called for and Waring and Rowden's offer was accepted.</p>  <p>This company merged with Baxter and Boyne to form Rowden, Baxter and Company but they found the job difficult to carry out. Their contract was finally taken over by the Public Works Department in December 1905. The entrance to Light's Passage, or the Port River was widened and deepened, pilings and wharves constructed. A railway line was extended from Port Adelaide to the new facility and in January 1908 Outer Harbor was opened to shipping. Passengers could now disembark directly to the wharf. There would be no more hazardous landings via slings or bosun chair.</p>  <p>The facilities at Outer Harbor continue to be improved with channel widening and deepening allowing larger ships than ever before to tie up there. The 53,600 tonne ANL <em>Warringa</em> container ship was the first of the new category of ship to use the facility on 2 March 2007.</p>  </div></div>",,-34.77,138.49,Book,Government Printer,Adelaide,,1884-1913,NULL

A number of photographs show the equipment being used and views of the work in progress.</p>  <p>The caption beneath the plan refers to Sir John Coode. Coode was a British engineer and examined the river and the coast south to Marino in 1886. He considered the area between the mouth of the river and Wonga Shoal the most appropriate site for a harbor and prepared a report to that effect.</p>  <p>There had been a number of proposals for an alternative harbor to Port Adelaide. The large mail and passenger steamers and many cargo vessels were becoming too large to use the inner harbor. One of the proposals had been for an extensive breakwater to be built at Marino. This was abandoned because of the rocky seabed and adjacent cliffs.</p>  <p>Finally in 1901 an Act of Parliament (number 765 of 1901) allowed a tender to be let for the construction of a harbour. Extensive dredging and reclaiming of land would be needed, wharves to be built and a separate contract was let for a railway line.</p>  <p>The contractors Rowden, Baxter and Company experienced difficulties in carrying out the work and eventually it was taken over by the Public Works Department.</p>  <p>Finally in January 1908 the new Outer Harbor was opened to shipping.

The first ship drawn up on this slip was the <em>Edinburgh</em> of 1500 tons. Fletcher's business continued to expand repairing sailing ships and iron steamers. The composite ship <em>Torrens</em> was one of the more notable vessels repaired at Fletcher's Shipyard. It had reportedly collided with an iceberg and its bow was severely damaged.</p>  In the early 1860s Fletcher had constructed two stern wheel paddle-steamers for the River Murray trade. <em>Settler</em> and <em>Lady Daly</em> were not successful on the Murray because of their length which made negotiating the many twists of the river difficult.</div>  <div>Henry Fletcher died in 1912 and eventually his slip and shipyard passed to the Harbors Board.

He was an artist who was often out in the field in the Adelaide Hills or the Flinders Ranges, and on the spot at mine sites, in city streets, at Port Adelaide, the races or at the Agricultural and Horticultural Society's annual show. He was part of Horrocks' expedition of 1846 to central Australia, where he offered a free service as official illustrator.</p>  <p>In 1840, Gill established a studio in Adelaide and advertised for those <em>desirous of obtaining correct likenesses of themselves, families</em><em>or friends</em>, animals, local scenery and residences, to contact him. He captured detailed scenes of colonial life in the streets of Adelaide and Melbourne, in the South Australian countryside and on the Victorian gold fields. Gill created a charicature folio of captioned portraits of well known Adelaideans named 'Heads of the people' which was later published (1850).</p>  <p>Gill used techniques he acquired in England in his youth and developed during his years in Australia. The immediacy and freshness of the water-colour painting technique was ideally suited to the lively style of the artist. Although Gill mostly restricted himself to the water-colour sketch, perhaps due to its portable and convenient nature (apart from his 'Heads of the people' lithographic series), his work faithfully describes the vastness of the land and the energy of its people. Gill displayed qualities of imagination, delicacy, and poetic feeling but is often only known as the artist of the gold fields.</p>  <p>Mary Thomas, the daughter of early pioneers and printing press operators, Robert and Mary Thomas, referred to wurlies, in her diary (PRG 1160/6, p. 42);</p>  <blockquote>  <p><em><u>Mar. 31, 1846.</u>   ....(near the Port) Some few natives have been paying us a visit lately. Cow-eeta (?) was one who seemed to be a civil, quiet man. Another was a woman named Coonartoo. Mr. Wilkinson stayed some time in our house. We made an arrangement to go see the blacks in the evening. At the time appointed Mr. Wilkinson left home with Mrs. Skipper and my sister Helen, preceded by Mr. Skipper, Mrs. Wilkinson, and myself. We all walked down to their wurlies, which are erected at a place some distance from the town. On arriving at this spot we could not help admiring the splendour and wildness of the scene, as we stood surrounded by, I should think, four or five hundred natives and among large trees of which some [were] half hidden by the darkness, while others were partly illuminated by the native fires and, by throwing out their broad shadows, appeared in bold relief. The fires, by which we were guided to their place, were numerous and appeared to be made in circles to some degree of uniformity. Instead of having them crowded together they left good spaces between each. After visiting the blacks belonging to two or three different tribes, we went to another part of the ground, where we found a large number of natives assembled and making preparations for a corroboree, which we waited to see. The result was very gratifying. A great number of blacks ranged themselves with scrupulous regularity in a sitting position so as to face the dancers. These consisted of the Moorundee tribe and their corroboree was intended to represent the stealing of a wife from another tribe. The whole scene was well acted, and what especially delighted me was that they kept such true time with foot and voice. Although I have often heard the corroboree I never discovered anything in the shape of a song so nearly resembling vocal music as that we were favoured with. I should think that there were about 150 of the Moorundee tribe dancing, and the number of spectators was afterwards swelled by several natives from Encounter Bay who not in general being on friendly terms with those from Moorundee, kept their spears in their hands instead of laying them down.

Built in Belfast in 1868, the <em>Star of Greece</em>, laden with 16,000 bags of wheat, was wrecked in a violent storm off Port Willunga on the 13th July 1888. She sailed from Port Adelaide with a north-westerly behind her. However during the night the wind changed direction and the storm arose with squalls and rain. The ship was driven off course and ashore at Port Willunga. It is estimated that up to 18 seamen lost their lives when the vessel broke up, or in attempting to swim ashore. A marble obelisk marks the grave of the eleven seamen whose bodies were recovered and buried in the cemetery of the Aldinga Methodist (now Uniting) Church.</p> <p>The site of the wreck lies close to suburban Adelaide making the wreck site one of the best known and most accessible in South Australia. It is marked with a buoy visible from the beach. The ship was only 200 metres from shore when it broke in two amidships at 2.00am.The alarm was raised at 7.20am by a young boy taking his morning walk but because the Willunga telegraph station did not open until 9.00am, the harbourmaster was unable to contact authorities to begin rescue operations.</p> <p>The appalling nature of this wreck revealed the flaws in the state of the lifeboat rescue network. As a result early in 1889 the task of managing it was placed in the hands of the colonial navy under Commander Walcot and the crew of HMCS <em>Protector</em>.

The building of the lighthouse even in the protected waters of northern Spencer Gulf was not without hazard: the ketch <em>Parara</em> which was bringing building supplies and water to the workers was wrecked at its moorings.</p> <p>The <em>Governor Musgrave</em> was built in 1874 for the South Australian government. She was intended to service the lighthouses and other navigational aids on the South Australian coast. Following service in World War I she was returned to this duty until management of lighthouses was taken over by the Commonwealth government in 1915, when she was transferred to Western Australia for the same duties.</p> Point Lowly lighthouse was originally 15 metres tall but its height was increased by a further 7.6 metres in 1909. In 1993 it was turned off by the Australian Maritime Safety Authoritiy which considered the light no longer necessary. The lighthouse was purchased by Whyalla City Council in 1995 and the light turned back on. In June 2009 Council was advised by the Department of Transport, Energy and Infrastructure that the light was no longer listed in official sources for navigational purposes and consequently caused safety issues. It has accordingly been turned off.</div></div>",,-32.99,137.77,Photograph,,,,1884-1913,NULL

The four masted barques <em>Pommern</em> and <em>Archibald Russell</em> can be seen beyond the ketches. The township was proclaimed in 1876 and the first jetty completed in January 1878. The first ship to take any of the grain harvest back to Europe loaded at the port 13 months later. The jetty was extended in 1883 with an L-shaped extension which provided shelter for the small vessels which frequented the port. Port Victoria is not a deep water port and the large ships needed to anchor offshore and were loaded from ketches and other small craft.</p>  <p>The town grew rapidly and by the mid 1880s three grain agents had offices in the town. Port Victoria was one of the largest ports in the colony in the late 19th century and was also one of the main ports for the export of the Yorke Peninsula grain harvest.</p>  <p>The grain was bagged at the farm and brought down to the port by wagon and later truck. Here they were checked by the grain agent and stored in great stacks. Every bag was handled manually. One stack could hold up to 23,000 bags. From the stacks the bags were transferred to carts for transporting to the ketches moored at the end of the jetty. These then carried the grain to the ships offshore. As the ketches held approximately only 3,000 bags it would take many trips to fill the vast holds of the largest ships which could carry up to 50,000 bags.</p>  <p>The harbour dues in Port Victoria were low because there was no berthing at the jetty. The large ships stayed out in deep water and relied on the ketch trade to fill their holds. This was one of the reasons Port Victoria remained popular so long with the large sailing ships. In 1949 the last of these vessels loaded at the port: <em>Pamir</em> and <em>Passat</em>. Bulk handling facilities established in the late 1950s at Wallaroo and Ardrossan meant the end of Port Victoria as a shipping port.</p>  </div></div>",,-34.46,137.45,Photograph,,,,1927-1939,NULL

The initial port was further upstream south of the Jervois Bridge but proved unsatisfactory. In 1840 the New Port was opened at the current Inner Harbor. The South Australian Company built the McLaren Wharf and the road between the port and Adelaide. From these beginnings the port burgeoned. Dredging improved the depths of the water and allowed ever larger vessels to use the port. The spoil was used to build up the adjoining land.</p>  <p>By this time in its development Port Adelaide was managed by the Marine Board under the terms of the Marine Board Act (Number 17 of 1860 <em>An Act to consolidate the Acts relating to the regulation of the ports, harbours, havens, ... and fort he better regulation of shipping ...</em>).</p>  <p>In 1879 work began on the New Dock or Port Adelaide Dock which would extend the harbour's capacity allowing another 15 or so vessels to discharge and load their cargoes. Adjacent to the new dock a number of handsome buildings were constructed; wool and grain stores for Elder Smith and Company, Joseph Stilling's warehouse, D &amp; J Fowler's warehouse. All of these buildings still stand, although not serving their original purpose. The new dock was officially opened 20 September 1880 having accidentally flooded two days previously.</p>  <p>In 1881 a new act for the management of South Australia's ports was enacted: the Marine and Navigation Act of 1881. Under the terms of this the responsibility for maintaining the docks and wharves could be placed in the hands of the Engineer-in-Chief. This power was invoked several years later.</p>  <p>Port Adelaide continued to grow, but by the late 19th century many of the largest steamships were mooring in the Gulf adjacent to the Semaphore jetty and discharging their mail and passengers there. The issue of a sufficiently large harbour for these vessels was finally resolved with the opening of Outer Harbor in 1908. Some shipping would continue to use the Inner Harbor, but many ships, including immigrant ships would use the facilities at Outer Harbor.</p></div>",,-34.78,138.44,Photograph,,,,1852-1883,NULL

The wharves are built along a tidal creek. The site for the future port was discovered in 1839 by Captain Germein in the government cutter <em>Water Witch</em> while on a supply run for the explorer Edward Eyre. It was re-discovered in 1846 by Captain Thompson in the <em>John Pirie</em>. A harbour in this region of the colony was considered to be an advantage to the pastoralists for shipment of their wool clip and the bringing in of supplies.</p>  <p>The harbour was in a creek, and was compared to Port Adelaide on its river - it would be sheltered from all winds. The first landing stage was built shortly after. Others followed. Canned meat was being exported from the harbour in 1869 and two years later the South Australian government surveyed a town. The wheat crops of the interior needed an export hub and a railway was built to the port to bring the harvest to the port.</p>  <p>Three hundred thousand bushels of wheat were shipped in the season of 1872-73. Improvements to the harbour were needed. Government sponsored dredging began in 1875, wharves were built, many replacing the jetties that had jutted out into the harbour. In the late 1870s nearly 300,000 tons of silt was removed from the creek enabling larger vessels to use the port.</p>  <p>The opening of the mines at Broken Hill and the laying of the railway line from there to Port Pirie was another boost for the town and port. The association with Broken Hill Proprietary Ltd was an ongoing advantage as the mines' needs for coal and timber were imported through Port Pirie, and the mines' ores exported through it.</p>  <p>During the 20th century further improvements were made; steel sheet piles replaced the old wooden wharves and bulk handling facilities were built in the 1960s. The chief exports are lead and zinc concentrates, grain and seeds.</p></div>",,-33.17,138,Photograph,,,,1884-1913,NULL

It would be another decade before the Federal and three State governments decided exactly how this could happen. In 1924 the agreement was amended to prioritise building of irrigation structures rather than those required for navigation. The riverboat trade was already declining due to the increase in railways which took trade away from them.</p>  <p>However the paddle steamers were also vital to the construction of the locks, carrying stone, cement and all other supplies that were needed for the construction of the locks, and for the families that built them.</p>  </div></div>",,-36.83,139.84,Photograph,,,,1919-1927,NULL

Moorundie was established by the Resident Magistrate and Protector of Aborigines, Edward John Eyre. Explorer Eyre had discovered the area in 1839 and later was granted 1411 acres there by the colonial government.  <p>Eyre was present at Moorundie from 1841-1844, during which period he monitored and attempted, with some success, to allay the conflicts between the indigenous inhabitants and the overlanders who passed through the area. He also distributed food rations to aboriginal groups in the region. Eyre grew irrigated crops on the river flats including maize, wheat, vegetables and orchards.</p>  Moorundie was occupied until 1856 when, partly due to flooding in the region, settlement was moved to newly established Blanchetown, approximately 5 kilometres upstream.</div>  <p>Mary Thomas, daughter of early pioneers and printing press operators, Robert and Mary Thomas, referred to the Moorundie and often referred 'kindly' to Aboriginal people in general, in her diary (PRG 1160/6, p. 42).

Cow-eeta (?) was one who seemed to be a civil, quiet man. Another was a woman named Coonartoo. Mr. Wilkinson stayed some time in our house. We made an arrangement to go see the blacks in the evening. At the time appointed Mr. Wilkinson left home with Mrs. Skipper and my sister Helen, preceded by Mr. Skipper, Mrs. Wilkinson, and myself. We all walked down to their wurlies, which are erected at a place some distance from the town. On arriving at this spot we could not help admiring the splendour and wildness of the scene, as we stood surrounded by, I should think, four or five hundred natives and among large trees of which some [were] half hidden by the darkness, while others were partly illuminated by the native fires and, by throwing out their broad shadows, appeared in bold relief. The fires, by which we were guided to their place, were numerous and appeared to be made in circles to some degree of uniformity. Instead of having them crowded together they left good spaces between each. After visiting the blacks belonging to two or three different tribes, we went to another part of the ground, where we found a large number of natives assembled and making preparations for a corroboree, which we waited to see. The result was very gratifying. A great number of blacks ranged themselves with scrupulous regularity in a sitting position so as to face the dancers. These consisted of the Moorundee tribe and their corroboree was intended to represent the stealing of a wife from another tribe. The whole scene was well acted, and what especially delighted me was that they kept such true time with foot and voice. Although I have often heard the corroboree I never discovered anything in the shape of a song so nearly resembling vocal music as that we were favoured with. I should think that there were about 150 of the Moorundee tribe dancing, and the number of spectators was afterwards swelled by several natives from Encounter Bay who not in general being on friendly terms with those from Moorundee, kept their spears in their hands instead of laying them down. Besides these we saw some from Kapunda.</em></p>  </blockquote>  </div></div>",,-29.38,135.86,Artwork,,,,1836-1851,NULL

Apprenticed at 14 to a foundry in Bath, he later was employed at the Swindon workshop of the Great Western Railway Company and progressed there to the position of head draughtsman and later assistant works manager.

Here he spent several months at moderately successful digging, before finding employment on the Geelong-Melbourne railway. He also undertook private work as a surveyor and engineer. From this work he made considerable money and in 1858 he returned to England. Edward Snell died in 1880.</p>  <p>During his time in Australia, Snell kept a diary which is profusely illustrated with detailed and humorous sketches of the world about him. Sketches of the scenes depicted in his watercolours can be found in the diary which is held by the State Library of Victoria and which was published in 1988. He comments on the events which motivated the drawings and which provide detail of the interaction with the local Aboriginal people. </p>  <p>Snell had sailed to the Peninsula from Port Adelaide on the cutter <em>Frolic</em>. After several false starts they were finally successful on 14 June.

Fortunately, some were saved and give us an insight into his decisions for the planning of Adelaide and also his character.</p>                <p>William Light was born on 27 April 1786 in Kuala Kedah in Malaya. His father Francis was the superintendent of Penang for the East India Company. At the age of six, Light was sent back to England where a family friend, Charles Doughty of Theberton in Suffolk, educated him. Light joined the Navy in the last years of the century but left after two years and some time later purchased a junior commission in the 4<sup>th</sup> Dragoons. He served with distinction on the Iberian Peninsula during the Napoleonic Wars. A good linguist and artist, he was employed on the Duke of Wellington's staff on mapping and reconnaissance duties.</p>                <p>Following the Napoleonic Wars, Light served in various parts of Great Britain, and retired from the Army in 1821 as a major. He later served in the Spanish revolutionary army with the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1824 he married the wealthy Mary Bennet and together they travelled in Europe and cruised the Mediterranean in their yacht <em>Gulnare</em>. They also spent time in Egypt where Light helped to recruit personnel for the Egyptian Navy, and later brought the paddle steamer <em>Nile</em> from England to join the Navy. It was at this time that he met John Hindmarsh, later to become Governor of South Australia. Light's Mediterranean sketches, most of which are beautiful watercolours, were produced in this period.</p>                <p>In January 1836 Light was appointed Surveyor General of South Australia, and sailed from England in the <em>Rapid</em> in May 1836. After first surveying Encounter Bay and rejecting this as an unsatisfactory harbour, as he later rejected Port Lincoln, he examined St Vincent's Gulf and found the entrance to the Port River. Impressed with the fertile plains and the likelihood that the Mt Lofty ranges would attract rain, he selected the site for the new settlement.</p>                <p>The Colonisation Commissioners had given Light quite unreasonable instructions to examine in detail some 1500 miles of coastline, select the best site, and survey the town site and the country sections, all with inadequate staff, equipment and no transport other than hand carts. In 1839 he published his account of his surveys <em><a href=http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au/record=b1345722>A brief journal of the proceedings of William Light</a></em> . In the Preface he wrote:</p>                <p>'The reasons that led me to fix Adelaide where it is I do not expect to be generally understood or calmly judged of at present. My enemies, however, by disputing their validity in every particular, have done me the good service of fixing the whole of the responsibility upon me. I am perfectly willing to bear it; and I leave it to posterity, and not to them, to decide whether I am entitled to praise or to blame.'</p>                <p>William Light died at his home at Thebarton on the River Torrens on 6 October 1839, and was buried in Light Square, Adelaide.</p>              </div>            </div>          ",,-35.73,137.58,Artwork,,South Australia,,Pre-1836,NULL

He later embarked upon his own businesses and worked in his later years as a baker. Richards was also known as an excellent violinist and organised concerts including <em>The Admella Shipwreck and Relief Fund</em> benefit concert of 1859 in Gawler, where he was first violinist in a performance of Handel's <em>Messiah</em>, consequently the first presentation of that piece in South Australia.</p>  <p>Also included in the family papers, is a photograph of a portrait miniature painting of William Richards <a href=http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au:1083/search/r?SEARCH=d+4718%2F2 title=Portrait miniature of William Richards - D 4718/2 (L)>(click here to view catalogue record)</a> and various information about the Richards family in Cornwall.

One of the most interesting details is the number of deaths recorded throughout the three month voyage. Richards counted 28 child deaths including his young daughter Caroline, one still born child and four adult deaths. He also explained that more children passengers perished in the weeks after landing mainly due to the effects of starvation on the voyage. After being on land for a while, Richards recorded six other ships had arrived with passengers and crew reporting fair treatment and no deaths onboard at all.

Both men had been sent out by their respective governments to chart and explore the unknown southern coast of Australia. Between them Flinders and Baudin explored, mapped and named most of the 3,700 kilometres of coastline from Ceduna in the west to Robe in the southeast, known in 1802 as 'the unknown coast'.</p> <p>A map was produced by the English expedition, led by Matthew Flinders, aboard the <em>Investigator</em>.

It was the first published map to show the entire South Australian coastline. The chart includes the area of the 1802 encounter between Baudin and Flinders at Encounter Bay, South Australia, and also shows part of the western coast of Victoria. The longitudes used for the chart are on the meridian of Paris rather than the Greenwich meridian.

The use of the name was not approved at that time, and 10 years later, the map was published in the atlas that accompanied <em>A Voyage to Terra Australis ....</em> as 'General chart of Terra Australis or Australia'.</p> <p>Flinders was not the first to use the name Australia for the continent of New Holland/New South Wales. The name had been used as early as 1625 by Samuel Purchas, and was actually a misprint for Austrialia del Espiritu Santo the name given by Fernandez de Quiros to the New Hebrides islands. He believed he had discovered a continent and named it for King Philip III of Spain, Archduke of Austria. The name Australia was used in other guises for the next 100 years or so, but was only specifically applied to Australia in 1794 by George Shaw in his book <em>Zoology of New Holland</em>. He writes of the 'vast island or rather continent of Australia, Australasia, or New Holland...'. Flinders may not have been the first to use the name, but he popularised it and Governor Lachlan Macquarie used the name and it was in common usage by the 1820s.</p> </div></div>",,-28.61,137.13,Book,Libraries Board of South Australia,Adelaide,Libraries Board of South Australia G. &amp; W.

Light's letter pre-dates the official decision on the location of the capital by five weeks. It was written on board the <em>Rapid</em> on 22 November 1836, the day after Light completed an exploration of the southern reaches of the Port River (Gulf St. Vincent).</p> <p>The letter confirms that by this stage Light fully intended the settlement to be located in the general area where Adelaide now stands, although he was still obliged to consider other places, including Encounter Bay and Port Lincoln. Writing to a friend Light gives a different emphasis than in his letter to the South Australian Commissioners written the same day, in which he indicates his preference for the site of Adelaide in less definite terms and adds his obligation to ... <em>look at other places first, before I fix on the capital, yet I feel assured...that I shall only be losing time.'</em></p> <p>The letter to George Jones shows that Light was excited and full of optimism about the potential of the harbour and the Adelaide plain <em>...to make this one of the finest settlements in the whole world</em> . A rough sketch shows that he intended the site of the capital to be south of the Port River and several miles inland from Holdfast Bay. The sketch includes notes on the terrain and possible uses of the land. A proposed canal connecting the city with Port Adelaide is also shown.</p> <p>The letter also indicates Light's frame of mind at this critical time, his optimism tempered with exasperation at the response of some settlers to the choice of site. Light anticipates that there will be opposition to the choice of the site, but is confident that history will prove him correct:</p> <p><em>...I have no doubts all will go on well, it will I am sure after I am dead and then, perhaps not till then the world will give me credit for being resolute now.</em></p> <p>This letter is featured on <a href=http://200years.auspost.com.au/html/loan/archive/view_detail/1287 target=_blank title=Australia Posts Letters of a nation website>Australia Post's Letters of a Nation website</a>.</p> </div></div>",,-29.38,135.86,Manuscript,,,,1836-1851,NULL

At a convention in Ireland in 1903 the rules of the group were set down, including a strict simplicity of lifestyle and complete rejection of current Christian doctrine and traditional worship styles. Following the convention William Irvine and two other men sailed to the United States of America to spread their gospel, while others went to South Africa, South America, China, Austria and New Zealand. Four members, John Hardie, William Carroll and his wife and Tom Turner sailed to Australia.</p>  <p>The group spread through the country districts of South Australia, with adherents visiting such places as Inman Valley in 1912 and Port Pirie in 1947.

In 1888 it loaded 19 sailing ships with the season's wheat, and the last very large ship used the port in 1939. For the next two decades smaller vessels used the jetty but the construction of bulk handling facilities at both Wallaroo and Port Pirie saw the demise of Port Germein.

After initially transporting the ore overland through Port Augusta, in 1900 BHP approached the South Australian government for a railway and jetty facilities. The Act to enable this was passed in December 1900 and the railway and jetty were operating 8 months later.

West Coast Shipping Company was founded about 1906 and in addition to a fleet of ketches introduced its steamship <em>Wookata</em> to the west coast trade. Later MV <em>Yandra</em> operating as part of Coast Steamships Company, plied the west coast ports. With its refrigerated storage it was an important link in the export of fresh fish for Adelaide and interstate markets.</p>  However, in 1920 jetty and berthing facilities were opened at nearby Thevenard, providing deeper water and more imprtantly a railway link with the rest of the Peninsula.

The latest harbour works in the 1880s were among the largest undertaken by the government to that time and cost 122,171 pounds: 192,000 tons of granite for the breakwater was blasted from Granite Island in seven blasts. Holes needed to be blasted into the limestone reef underlying the sea bed for the screw piles of the jetty.</p>  <p>Victor Harbor had been proclaimed a port in 1838, with the hope that it might also become the capital of South Australia. This hope was in vain and for many years Victor Harbor languished as a small port with goods being transported by small craft which beached at low tide, or else used a small jetty under The Bluff.</p>  <p>The advent of River Murray shipping and the proven unsuitability of Port Elliot as an outlet for the river trade, brought about a boost for Victor Harbor's claims as a port. However by the 1920s, and despite further visits by Royal Australian Navy, and Royal Navy vessels, the harbour's role as a working port was over.</p></div>",,-35.55,138.61,Photograph,,,,1884-1913,NULL

The watchman on an adjacent ship called the police and fire brigades. The harbor master and the Port Adelaide and Semaphore brigades were quickly in attendance; the firefloat was also called out. The brigade from Wakefield Street headquarters was called out as those already in attendance were unable to cope with the intensity of the fire. By 10.30pm it appeared the fire was under control.</p>  <p>Then the ship exploded: pieces of ship were blown into the air, through the walls of the adjacent wharf shed, through the wharf; fire hoses were cut and the road surface was blasted in all directions. The firefloat was damaged when a flying case of petrol punched through the deck. Fire brigades which were already heading back to base, returned to renew the fight. Four firemen died, 10 were injured.</p>  <p>A number of crew members and private citizens were awarded medals and certificates from the Royal Humane Society of Australiasia.

The explosion blasted metal through adjacent sheds and the wharf, road metal was torn up. Internally the ship's hull buckled and the bulwarks were warped in the intense heat of the fire. The ship was written off, stripped of salvagable items and towed to the North Arm of the Port River where it was expected it would remain.</p>  London engineers WJ and ST Russell bought the wreck and arranged for it to be towed to the Netherlands. Two ocean-going tugs <em>Vlaanderen</em> and <em>Willem Barrendz</em> undertook the tow after the <em>City of Singapore</em> had been braced internally with steel girders. They left 11 April 1925, almost a year since the ship had arrived in Port Adelaide. After an eventful towing job, in which the ship had to be cut loose during a violent storm in the Indian Ocean, <em>City of Singapore</em> reached Rotterdam after a five month tow. It was extensively repaired and re-purchased by the original owners. <em>City of Singapore</em> was torpedoed and sunk 1 May 1943 while on convoy from India to England.

However this was found to be rotten and a stone building was planned. The foundation stone was laid 26 January 1838 by Governor Hindmarsh and construction completed by that August. It was the colony's first church, and was enlarged in 1845 and 1889. The clock was installed shortly thereafter as no other suitable building was available. By 1844 the church building was declared unsafe, and partially rebuilt, with higher walls and a new turret. There is a stained glass window dated 1836 which is all that remains of the original prefabricated building sent out from England. In the 1880s architect Edward John Woods made further alterations in which the height of the tower was increased, and the walls raised. The tower was topped with pinnacles and the walls were buttressed. The building materials are limestone and sandstone.</p> <p><strong>Government House</strong></p> <p>South Australia's first governor John Hindmarsh lived in a thatched hut with one fireplace. His successor George Gawler appointed a board to consider a new residence. Kingston was a member of this board. The new Government House had 12 rooms, was two storeys high, and was built of stone quarried from along the River Torrens. This building was completed in 1840, and much of it still survives today. A two storey extension was added in 1855-56, and further extensions continued throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Government House is on a prominent site at the corner of North Terrace and King William Road and adjacent to Parliament House.</p> <p><strong>Adelaide Gaol</strong></p> <p>Designed by George Strickland Kingston, Adelaide Gaol is one of the oldest remaining buildings in Adelaide. Building began in 1840 with limestone quarried from along the River Torrens. Red brick was used for the interior walls and was made on site. Building was protracted by disputes and the second half of the gaol was built between 1847 and 1850. Alterations were made to the building 1862-64 and again in 1880, but these were in sympathy with the original work.</p> <p><strong>Government Office (Treasury Building)</strong></p> <p>Only the site, at the corner of King William and Flinders Streets, part of a wall and an arched window, together with the vaults, furnace and well remain of the original government offices, which were first constructed in 1839, and designed by George Strickland Kingston. Designed in an oblong with a central courtyard the building was essentially rebuilt between 1858 and 1907. It housed the Colonial Secretary, Treasurer, Accountant general, the Land Office and Survey Office. During the Victorian gold rush, the armed gold escorts delivered their loads here, where the gold was smelted into ingots in the vaults below. Today the building has been sensitively restored and refurbished as the Medina Serviced Apartments.</p> <p><strong>Congregational Chapel</strong></p> <p>Built in Freeman Street (later Gawler Place) this was the first Congregational Church in South Australia and was subsequently replaced by Stow Memorial Church in Flinders Street. The Chapel was then used by a number of businesses before being subsumed in the ING Building in Pirie Street.</p> <p><strong>South Australian School Society</strong></p> <p>This occupied a site on North",,-29.38,135.86,Map,J.C.

He established a pharmacy in Rundle Street, Adelaide, in May 1845, importing some of his stock of pharmaceuticals and chemicals from England, but also manufacturing his own supplies. He sold medicines, veterinary drugs and preparations, perfumes and sundries. The business was a success despite the economic hardships of the time and by 1850 Faulding employed 'travelling salesmen' to go about the colony with samples of the company's merchandise.</p>  <p>In 1861, Faulding went into partnership with Luther Scammell and the company FH Faulding &amp; Co. wholesale druggists and manufacturing chemists was created. He left the day to day running of the business to Scammell, but Faulding kept up with recent medical discoveries - for example, after reading of the English surgeon Joseph Lister's success in minimising the risk of infection after surgery with the use of antiseptics, FH Faulding &amp; Co. began manufacturing antiseptics. The company's flagship product in this area was 'Solyptol', an antiseptic based on eucalyptus oil. Faulding also sold chloroform and cocaine preparations - both legitimately used for medicinal purposes at the time.</p>  <p>Faulding became a prominent business leader in Adelaide as a result of his successful business, but also because of his successful property speculations which secured his prosperity. He served on the Adelaide City Council and was made a trustee of the Savings Bank of South Australia in 1861 and made director of the Bank of Adelaide in 1867.</p>  </div></div>",,-29.38,135.86,Photograph,,,,1836-1851,NULL

The Company formed for the immediate purpose of encouraging the preliminary purchase of land since the Commissioners' decision to fix the price of land at twenty shillings per acre had brought land sales to a standstill, arousing doubts about whether the Colonization Commission would succeed in fulfilling the terms of the South Australian Act, by which it was obliged to sell 35,000 pounds worth of land before the Imperial authorities would consent to the colonization venture.</p>  <p>Giles gave encouragement to the Company's mining ventures. A silver-lead mine had been operated by the Company at Glen Osmond since 1841, and this was followed by the opening of copper-lead mines at Rapid Bay, Kapunda, Burra (Kooringa) and Kanmantoo. Yet the Company's mining operations were never greatly successful and in the case of the Kanmantoo mines proved a serious loss, in addition to which they had the effect of drawing labour away from farming and pastoral occupations - as did the Victorian gold rushes of 1851-1852. At this time, the Company refrained from pressing for the recovery of outstanding rents, in an attempt to induce tenants to remain on their properties.</p>  <p>Although the Company continued for the next half century to contribute markedly to South Australia's progress and prosperity, it never really regained the commercial ascendancy enjoyed during the early years of settlement. Already by 1860 the Company had divested itself of interests in whaling, ship-building and banking, and had largely abandoned its mining and pastoral pursuits to concentrate almost exclusively on agricultural production. The company continued to wind down over time and eventually all business directly relating to the South Australian Company ceased on 17 March 1949.</p>  </div></div>",,-29.38,135.86,Artwork,,,,1836-1851,NULL

It is almost certain that Peron was responsible for the naming of many South Australian features after French scientists, artists and members of the expedition, including himself. Louis de Freycinet drew up the charts and maps of the expedition. Baudin had been discredited by both early deserters of the expedition and the returning travellers, and French authorities were embarrassed by the apparent failure of the voyage. Freycinet bestowed his own choice of place names to South Australian locations, disregarding names that Baudin had recorded earlier.

At the time appointed Mr. Wilkinson left home with Mrs. Skipper and my sister Helen, preceded by Mr. Skipper, Mrs. Wilkinson, and myself. We all walked down to their wurlies, which are erected at a place some distance from the town. On arriving at this spot we could not help admiring the splendour and wildness of the scene, as we stood surrounded by, I should think, four or five hundred natives and among large trees of which some [were] half hidden by the darkness, while others were partly illuminated by the native fires and, by throwing out their broad shadows, appeared in bold relief. The fires, by which we were guided to their place, were numerous and appeared to be made in circles to some degree of uniformity. Instead of having them crowded together they left good spaces between each. After visiting the blacks belonging to two or three different tribes, we went to another part of the ground, where we found a large number of natives assembled and making preparations for a corroboree, which we waited to see. The result was very gratifying. A great number of blacks ranged themselves with scrupulous regularity in a sitting position so as to face the dancers. These consisted of the Moorundee tribe and their corroboree was intended to represent the stealing of a wife from another tribe. The whole scene was well acted, and what especially delighted me was that they kept such true time with foot and voice. Although I have often heard the corroboree I never discovered anything in the shape of a song so nearly resembling vocal music as that we were favoured with. I should think that there were about 150 of the Moorundee tribe dancing, and the number of spectators was afterwards swelled by several natives from Encounter Bay who not in general being on friendly terms ",,-34.78,138.44,Artwork,Thomas McLean,London,"Giles, J.W.",1836-1851,NULL

The country blocks were his immediate priority. This was a task that the first Surveyor-General, William Light had been unable to complete because of interference from London. Frome had an onerous task as the colonists clamoured for their land. He had not only to revise the work that had been inadequately marked by George Kingston, Light's second-in-command, but also to undertake the commencement of the Special Surveys of very large country blocks. By 1841 Frome had laid out roads and secondary towns and taken accurate trigonometrical survey to the limits of settlement.

Previous to his arrival in the colony he was engaged by a large and influential English Syndicate to visit Spain in search of coal and other minerals. Immediately after his arrival here he was commissioned by Mr. Walters, the well-known partner of the late <a href=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A040403b.htm?hilite=hart%3Bjohn>Captain Hart</a>, to visit our northern country for a similar purpose, and, strange to say, he then indicated to his employer that the neighbourhood of what is now Leigh's Creek mostly favoured the existence of bituminiferous [bitumen] deposits. Subsequently in 1860 he engaged as a wheatbuyer in Gawler for the firm of Messrs. Hart and Hughes. Afterwards he was engaged by Mr. E.M. Bagot in the preparation of what was subsequently patented as Bagot's extract of meat, samples of which were publicly tested in the library of this office. Large consignments of it were afterwards forwarded to the Northern Territory in the early years of her golden age. Then Mr. Francis was employed by the Government in examining the waters of Lake Alexandrina during the prevalence of what was termed lake scum, which proved so disastrous to both cattle and sheep. He was afterwards deputed to make analytical tests of the water from several depth.[sic] conserved in the reservoir at Thornden Parks [sic]. But what perhaps brought him most prominently under the notice of the public was his connection with the South Australian Institute, where the Board of Governors granted him the use of the old gas-house as a laboratory and for the establishment of chemical classes. The building was fitted up for him for the latter purpose, and the cemented sided well of the first gasometer worked in Adelaide was after the initiation of the S.A. Gas Company used by him as a cellar. His first pupil there was Mr. G.A. Goyder, the present Government Analytical Chemist, and he with many others now living can testify to the practical and masterly tuition they received from the deceased gentleman. Mr. Francis discontinued his work at the Institute laboratory in 1882, the building being required for purposes connected with the Museum.</p> <p>Coal was mined in small quantities at Leigh Creek from 1888, but not in commercial quantities until 1943 when the South Australian government determined to make the state more self-sufficient for its power needs.</p> <p>In 1878 Mr Francis corresponded with Charles Darwin sending him plant specimens and enquiring from Darwin if he had researched the colouring of plants. Darwin's reply to Francis has been preserved and the letter was attached by a previous owner of Darwin's book <a href=http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au/record=b1292740><em>Insectivorous plants</em></a> now in the State Library's collection.</p></div>",,-29.38,135.86,Photograph,,,,1836-1851,NULL

Hawson's father Henry Hawson, originally of St. Saviour's, in Dartmouth, Devonshire, England married Elizabeth Emlyn Cowell, of Torr. Captain Hawson was the eldest son of their 13 children.</p> <p>According to Kenyon in <em>'The Story of South Australia: Its Discoverers and Founders'</em>, the Hawson family was the most historic on the Eyre Peninsula. Captain Cowell Hawson and family finally arrived at Port Lincoln in 1839 on the schooner <em>Abeona</em>, firstly via Sydney, New South Wales and then arriving at Port Adelaide in 1837. The <em>Abeona</em> carried with her, a large cargo of cedar wood which was used in the construction of their first home at Kirton Point, where they took up 6000 hectares including his 'Polda' station, Little Swamp, and the 'Towalla' homestead withing the site of Port Lincoln, where he also acted as Harbor and Port Master. The <em>Aboena</em> was eventually sold but soon wrecked on King's Island in Bass Straight.</p> <p>The <em>Pastoral Pioneers of South Australia</em> publication (Vol II., p. 153), refers to the captain in 1839, leading an expedition, naming several fresh water rivers and creeks like the Mississipi River and Rossiter Vale, along the way. He explored the region of Port Lincoln, discovering Mount Dutton, and the Hawson Range (Marble Range) penetrating as far as Coffin Bay. He was involved with Robert Tod's expedition which named the Tod River, Mount Gawler, Happy Valley and Cowan Vale. He also accompanied and contributed financially to, Darke's expedition of 1844. Hawson put his name to the establishment at Boston Bay and was one of the two original trustees of the Port Lincoln Survey Association. The trail blazed by Hawson was followed by his descendant for generations, many of whom occupied the homestead 'Towalla'.</p> <p>The Captain married Frances Maria Brodribb (1822-1911) in Tasmania 1840. They had six children, one of whom, son Francis Tapley Hawson (aged 10), was reportedly the first white victim of a murder by spearing, committed by an Aboriginal person in that area 5 October 1840. A memorial was erected to his memory.</p> </div></div>",,-34.74,135.92,Artwork,,,,Pre-1836,NULL

Frome had an onerous task as the colonists clamoured for their land. He had not only to revise the work that had been inadequately marked by George Kingston, Light's second-in-command, but also to undertake the commencement of the Special Surveys of very large country blocks. By 1841 Frome had laid out roads and secondary towns and taken accurate trigonometrical survey to the limits of settlement.

For instance on 28 January 1833 5 tails indicated that 5 whales had been caught; these were then processed or 'tried out' over the next five days; on 9 May 1833 Burton drew nine tails for the nine whales caught.</p>  <p>There were however days when the boats returned with no catches and reports of lost 'irons' (harpoons) and many metres of rope lost as well.

The country blocks were his immediate priority. This was a task that the first Surveyor-General, William Light had been unable to complete because of interference from London. Frome had an onerous task as the colonists clamoured for their land. He had not only to revise the work that had been inadequately marked by George Kingston, Light's second-in-command, but also to undertake the commencement of the Special Surveys of very large country blocks. By 1841 Frome had laid out roads and secondary towns and taken accurate trigonometrical survey to the limits of settlement. Frome returned to England in 1849 and retired in 1877 with the rank of General.</p></div>",,-29.38,135.86,Artwork,,,,1836-1851,NULL

Skipper was interested in art from an early age and was encouraged by his uncle James Stark, a noted landscape painter. During his time at sea Skipper kept a journal which he illustrated with sketches. In 1836 he immigrated to South Australia, arriving on the <em>Africaine</em> (ship) 6 November. On the voyage Skipper met Frances Thomas, whose father Robert was to establish South Australia's first newspaper, the <em><a href=/site/page.cfm?u=760&amp;c=3375>South Australian gazette and colonial register</a></em>. They married in December 1839.</p>  <p>In South Australia Skipper commenced his legal career and was articled to Charles Mann the Advocate-General and Crown Solicitor of South Australia and later worked with EC Gwynne. Skipper was admitted as an attorney and proctor of the South Australian Supreme Court in March 1840. He continued his artistic pursuits however, and sketched many scenes depicting the early years of European settlement in South Australia. Skipper's satirical watercolour of <em><a href=/site/page.cfm?u=760&amp;c=4201>Pioneers landing at Port Adelaide</a></em> in 1839 mocks the primitive conditions which new settlers found when they arrived in the colony.

On his return to South Australia he was appointed clerk of the Local Court of Port Adelaide; a position he held until his retirement. Skipper's sketches and paintings provide a valuable record of life in South Australia from 1836. His key achievements include his arrival to South Australia 1836 articled to Charles Mann, Advocate-General and Crown Solicitor, admitted as attorney and proctor of the South Australian Supreme Court March 1840, clerk of the Local Court of Port Adelaide 1852-1872.</p>  <p>Skipper is known for his tiny detailed sketches in the margins of his diaries and published books in his possession. The State Library of South Australia holds several examples including <em><a href=http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au/record=b1367340>Psellus' dialogue on the operation of daemons</a></em> and <em><a href=http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au/record=b1337918>South Australian almanack and general directory for 1841</a></em>.

After first surveying Encounter Bay and rejecting this as an unsatisfactory harbour, as he later rejected Port Lincoln, Light examined St Vincent's Gulf and found the entrance to the Port River. Impressed with the fertile plains and the likelihood that the Mt Lofty Ranges would attract rain, he selected the site for the new settlement.</p>  <p>Light had been given quite unreasonable instructions by the Colonization Commissioners to examine in detail some 1500 miles of coastline, select the best site, and survey the town site and the country sections - all with inadequate staff, equipment, and no transport other than hand carts. In 1839, he published his account of his surveys <em><a href=http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au/record=b1345722>A brief journal of the proceedings of William Light</a></em> (subsequently published as a <a href=http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au/record=b1001506>facsimile</a> in 1962, in the Preface of which he wrote:</p>  <blockquote>  <p>The reasons that led me to fix Adelaide where it is I do not expect to be generally understood or calmly judged of at present. My enemies, however, by disputing their validity in every particular, have done me the good service of fixing the whole of the responsibility upon me. I am perfectly willing to bear it; and I leave it to posterity, and not to them, to decide whether I am entitled to praise or to blame.</p>  </blockquote>  <p>A fire in his home destroyed many of Light's papers and sketchbooks in January 1839. We are fortunate that some were saved and have been handed down for posterity. William Light died of tuberculosis at his home at Thebarton on the River Torrens on 6 October 1839, and was buried in Light Square, Adelaide.</p>  <p>Details the harbour survey made in the <em>Rapid</em> commencing 30 August 1838, featuring rough sketches of Cape Jervis &amp; SA Company Point, Kangaroo Island, are included in one of Light's notebooks.

The ship moored in the stream, under repair, is the <em>Ville de Bordeaux</em>; she is a French vessel, and was captured by the Custom-house officers at the Port for their illicit trading. Outside the bar is a light ship, marking the entrance to the harbour, the approach to which has been admirably buoyed by Captain Lipson ...'.</p>  Adelaide's port was initially higher up the Port River, south of the present Jervois Bridge. Dubbed Port Misery because disembarking passengers had to struggle through mangrove swamp and over sandhills before commencing the trek to Adelaide, the site was quickly abandoned and in May 1839 work began on the 'New Port' some distance downstream, and the site of the present Inner Harbor. The South Australian Company quickly built the first wharf, McLaren Wharf, and began construction of the road to Adelaide. Port Adelaide continued to expand.

By 21 he was an acting adjutant and drill supervisor. After being refused the vacant adjutancy position in which he was acting, Tolmer decided to migrate to South Australia.</p> <p>In 1836 he had secretly married Mary Carter. They arrived in Adelaide with their infant son on the ship, <em>Branken Moor</em> on 8 February 1840. Tolmer carried a letter of introduction to Governor George Gawler and was almost immedialtely made sub-inspector of police, then rapidly promoted to inspector. His primary task was to organise a mounted police branch. Much of his time was then spent in the bush chasing cattle thieves, murderers, smugglers and looking for illegal alcohol stills.</p> <p>After having been an acting commissioner and police magistrate, Alexander Tolmer became Commissioner of Police in 1852. He soon formed a native police force and introduced a detective branch. In the early 1850s, The Victorian gold rush led to a currency drain from South Australia. The resulting <a href=http://www.sapolicehistory.org/gold.html>Bullion Act of 1852</a> prompted Tolmer to suggest an overland gold escort service from Victoria to South Australia. He accompanied the first escort on 10 February 1852 and returned a month later with gold worth 21,000 pounds. The Gold Escorts lasted until December 1853 and saved South Australlia's economy .</p> <p>After complaints about police disorganisation, mainly due to during Tolmer's long absences and a number of public disputes with his subordinates, an official inquiry was held. In November 1853 he was demoted. However he remained in the police force, as inspector and then superintendent until 1856.</p> <p>Tolmer then took on a range of positions, including those of crown lands ranger and inspecting ranger in the 1860s. In 1877 he became a sub-inspector of credit lands at a salary of 330 pounds.</p> <p>Tolmer's first wife had died in 1867, leaving him with three children.

Wheat growing in the region to the north and east of Port Augusta also increased. The port's shipping movements peaked with more overseas vessels visiting. Some, which delivered rails for the railway construction work, were able to leave with a full load of wool or wheat. It was not unusual however for vessels to arrive in ballast to collect a cargo, or vice versa.</p>  <p>The northern railway following its completion began to have its effect on Port Augusta as it by passed it, going through Quorn instead. The great Federation drought of the 1890s caused difficulties for the frontier port - goods and supplies came in for the local people but there was little in the way of exports.</p>  <p>By the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, ships bringing coal for the railway or timber for sleepers and embankments predominated. Provision ships continued to come on a near weekly basis, but eventually these would be replaced by road traffic. The introduction of diesel locomotives by the Commonwealth Railway was the final blow for Port Augusta's shipping fortunes. The wool clip was also carried by road or rail transport, as were the town's supplies. In 1958 the regular supply ship was cancelled.

He was an artist who was often out in the field in the Adelaide Hills or the Flinders Ranges, and on the spot at mine sites, in city streets, at Port Adelaide, the races or at the Agricultural and Horticultural Society's annual show. He was part of Horrocks' expedition of 1846 to central Australia, where he offered a free service as official illustrator.</p>  <p>In 1840, Gill established a studio in Adelaide and advertised for those <em>desirous of obtaining correct likenesses of themselves, families</em> <em>or friends</em>, animals, local scenery and residences, to contact him. He captured detailed scenes of colonial life in the streets of Adelaide and Melbourne, in the South Australian countryside and on the Victorian gold fields. Gill created a charicature folio of captioned portraits of well known Adelaideans named 'Heads of the people' which was later published (1850).</p>  <p>Gill used techniques he acquired in England in his youth and developed during his years in Australia. The immediacy and freshness of the water-colour painting technique was ideally suited to the lively style of the artist. Although Gill mostly restricted himself to the water-colour sketch, perhaps due to its portable and convenient nature (apart from his 'Heads of the people' lithographic series), his work faithfully describes the vastness of the land and the energy of its people. Gill displayed qualities of imagination, delicacy, and poetic feeling but is often only known as the artist of the gold fields.</p>  </div></div>",,-34.93,138.59,Artwork,,,,1836-1851,NULL

Ritch of Port Adelaide, who later went into partnership with Captain Tom Garnaut. <em>Lulu</em> was 43 tons and distinguished by an ugly 'cut off' square stern.

Later the local grain harvest would also be exported through Port Pirie. However it was the discovery of silver/lead ore at Broken Hill which saw a major expansion at the port when the mine owners at Broken Hill decided in favour of Port Pirie rather than shipping through ports in New South Wales. The railway line to the New South Wales border was laid by June 1887; this connected with the private Silverton Tramway Company. With the railway line open everything for and from Broken Hill went through Port Pirie - timber for the mines, coal and mining gear and outwards the ore and processed minerals. Smelters were built at Port Pirie and the face of the town changed rapidly - it became an industrial town as well as a port.</p>  <p>The port expanded rapidly with its association with BHP, and was an important link with the company's development at Whyalla on the opposite side of the gulf.</p>  </div></div>",,-33.17,138,Photograph,,,,,NULL

During the 'Great Strike' of 1874, it was reported that 1200 disgruntled miners met at Moonta. (<em>Kadina and Wallaroo times</em>, 8 April 1874, p. 3) In 1889, over 2,000 miners met the mine manager, Captain HR Hancock at Moonta with their grievances. (<em>Kadina Wallaroo times</em>, 21 May 1889, p. 2) When the mines closed in 1923 - following progressive falls in the world copper price - there were reportedly 1,450 men thrown out of work.

However the underlying issue was the end of the global demand for copper, which had temporarily been resucitated for armaments during the First World War. Many local people believed that there was still great copper wealth at Moonta, if only there was finances to extract it. A few years later, in 1931, the 'Moonta Prospecting Syndicate' was formed and with state and federal unemployment grants, employed 60 men in a small mining revival.

Leaving Batavia in Java he sailed south of the known Dutch discoveries of the continent and continuing east he discovered and named Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania). Continuing to the east and then north he discovered the west coast of New Zealand. Tasman returned to Java round the north coast of New Guinea. He was sent out again in 1643, to search for a passage between Carpentaria (Cape York Peninsula) and New Guinea. Deterred by the reefs and shoals of the strait (now known as Torres Strait), and which gave the appearance of land, Tasman instead explored the north coast of New Holland.</p> <p>Tasman's ships on his historic discovery of Tasmania (Van Diemen's Land) were the <em>Zeehaen</em> and <em>Heemskerck</em>. It was Matthew Flinders in his 1798-99 circumnavigation of Tasmania who named two prominent mountains on the west coast of the island after Tasman's ships: Mount Zeehan and Mount Heemskirk.</p> <p>Torres Strait had been discovered in 1606 by the Spaniard Luis Vaez de Torres, the commander of one of the ships of a Spanish expedition led by Pedro Fernandez de Quiros which had sailed from Peru to search for the unknown South Land. De Quiros discovered Vanuatu. Torres was separated from the expedition, and sailing south west discovered the strait between New Guinea and Australia and which was later named for him. He then sailed to Manila in the Philippines. The Spanish suppressed all knowledge of the strait, and it was not until 1762 that Alexander Dalrymple found Torres' report in the archives in Manila. James Cook used this information and was only the second European to navigate the strait.</p> <p>The discoveries by Tasman and other Dutch explorers of the New Holland coastline are shown in the map published in 1663 by Melchisedec <a href=/site/page.cfm?u=197&amp;c=1165>Thevenot</a>.</p></div>",,-28.61,137.13,Book,Frederik Muller (F.

His descriptions of the land adjacent to the river in its lower reaches contributed to the decision for the settlement of South Australia. He writes in general of the lower river below modern Morgan as follows:</p>  <blockquote>  <p><span>'As we proceeeded down it, the valley expanded to the width of two miles; the alluvial flats became proportionally larger; and a small lake generally occupied their centre. They were extensively covered with reeds and grass, for which reason, notwithstanding that they were little elevated above the level of the stream, I do not think they are subject to overflow... the valley may be decidedly laid down as a most desirable spot, whether we regard the richness of its soil, its rock formation, its locality, or the extreme facility of water communication along it.' (Sturt, vol. 2, pp151/52)</span></p>  </blockquote>  <p>In 1839 Edward Eyre returned to Adelaide from explorations to the north of the Spencer Gulf by travelling down the River Murray.

Dubbed 'Port Misery' because disembarking passengers had to struggle through mangrove swamp and over sandhills before commencing the trek to Adelaide, the site was quickly abandoned and in May 1839 work began on the 'New Port' some distance downstream, and the site of the present Inner Harbor.

At the time appointed Mr. Wilkinson left home with Mrs. Skipper and my sister Helen, preceded by Mr. Skipper, Mrs. Wilkinson, and myself. We all walked down to their wurlies, which are erected at a place some distance from the town. On arriving at this spot we could not help admiring the splendour and wildness of the scene, as we stood surrounded by, I should think, four or five hundred natives and among large trees of which some [were] half hidden by the darkness, while others were partly illuminated by the native fires and, by throwing out their broad shadows, appeared in bold relief. The fires, by which we were guided to their place, were numerous and appeared to be made in circles to some degree of uniformity. Instead of having them crowded together they left good spaces between each. After visiting the blacks belonging to two or three different tribes, we went to another part of the ground, where we found a large number of natives assembled and making preparations for a corroboree, which we waited to see. The result was very gratifying. A great number of blacks ranged themselves with scrupulous regularity in a sitting position so as to face the dancers. These consisted of the Moorundee tribe and their corroboree was intended to represent the stealing of a wife from another tribe. The whole scene was well acted, and what especially delighted me was that they kept such true time with foot and voice. Although I have often heard the corroboree I never discovered anything in the shape of a song so nearly resembling vocal music as that we were favoured with. I should think that there were about 150 of the Moorundee tribe dancing, and the number of spectators was afterwards swelled by several natives from Encounter Bay who not in general being on friendly terms with",,-34.78,138.44,Artwork,Thomas McLean,London,"Giles, J.W.",1836-1851,NULL

Due to the detention of Matthew Flinders on Ile de France (Mauritius) by the French governor General DeCaen for over six years, Flinders was unable to have his chart of the continent published despite having made the first circumnavigation of the continent in 1802-3.

His account of the expedition <em>A <a href=http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au/record=b1298521>voyage to Terra Australis</a></em>, with <em>Atlas</em>, was published on 18 July 1814, and he died the following day.</p> <p>The French had taken the opportunity with their earlier publication to ensure that their names for portions of the Australian coast were shown on the map: notably Terre Napoleon for south eastern Australia, and Golfe Bonaparte and Golfe Josephine and Ile Decres in South Australia, thereby denying Flinders' prior discovery of this portion of the South Australian coastline.

By 1840 it was decided that a new gaol was needed; Civil Engineer and Inspector of Public Works George Strickland Kingston drew up the plans for a gaol in May 1840.</p>  <p>Kingston's design and concept for the gaol was not unique, as it was a design similar to the American radiating plan in use at the time, as well as that used at the English Pentonville Prison which was considered a model prison for the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Note that the second tower in the illustration and in the building lacks the dramatic crenellations of the front tower.</p>  <p>The gaol ceased being used as a prison in 1988, and is now a heritage site under the custodianship of the Adelaide Gaol Preservation Society.</p>  <p>This building is listed on the Register of the National Estate and on the South Australian Heritage Register.</p>  <p>Born in Scotland, James Henderson came out to Australia for health reasons, travelling with a party of Royal Engineers under E.C.

In 1841 he transferred to the Public Works Department where he remained until returning to England in 1851.

It was composed of Carrara marble with elegant black and white paving. Some of the original features of the arcade included three fountains placed along the main promenade, Turkish Baths and an underground tearoom.</p> <p>The interior of the arcade was illuminated throughout by electricity provided by a generator located near where the Manhattan drycleaners is now situated.

It took six men 10 minutes to open the bridge using a capstan. By 1880 the bridge's opening was found to be too small for the increasing size of ships, and business and shipping interests in Port Adelaide began lobbying for a new bridge. By August 1882 the bridge had been permanently swung open as a temporary measure.</p>  <p>A new iron bridge was designed by the Engineer-in-Chief Henry Mais and built by Handysides of Derby, England. It was shipped in May 1883, arriving in Port Adelaide 27 July and was erected in five weeks. At its official opening the bridge was named Robinson's bridge after the Governor of South Australia. It was 129 feet long, with a 20 feet roadway and two footpaths. It could be swung open by two men with a key turned by a hand lever and provided a 60 feet wide passage for shipping into the Company Basin. Rail lines carried freight across to the wharves on the far side. By 1920 the opening of the bridge was being effected by a 15hp electric motor.</p>  <p>The Robinson Bridge was closed in March 1935 and demolished later that year.

Manufactured by the Edge Moor Iron Company of Delaware the bridge was shipped in April 1880 and after arrival took only four weeks to assemble and mount on the foundations which had been prepared previously.</p>  <p>Named the Fisher Bridge at its official opening in September, the bridge was 128 feet long and 32 feet wide and capable of carrying a load of 80 tons.

The government finally agreed to build a bridge providing businesses contributed to the cost. In January 1859 the Lefevre Peninsula bridge was completed.</p>  <p>The bridge was a continuation of St Vincent Street, crossing the Old Port Reach. It was 719 feet long and 18 feet wide with a central drawbridge and was constructed of Western Australian jarrah and Tasmanian stringybark. Within months repairs were required, and the central drawbridge was used on only one occasion. By 1869 the bridge was dilapidated and calls were made for a replacement bridge.

By late 1874 the decision was made and construction began in April 1875. The old bridge would remain in use while the new one was built alongside: this at least was the plan, but in fact a temporary bridge needed to be built, as the construction work on the approaches to the bridge made the old bridge unsafe. Once the temporary bridge was in place the old Port Bridge was demolished.</p>  <p>Meanwhile construction of the new or Jervois bridge continued. The bridge had a central swinging section to allow the passage of shipping. This was built in Newcastle-on-Tyne, England. On 31 December 1875 a train crossed the bridge to test it and the swinging central section was tested. The Jervois bridge was 693 feet long with a swing section of 163 feet which provided a shipping channel 47 feet wide. The bridge was 56 feet wide with two footpaths, and room for rail and road transport.</p>  <p>The bridge-keeper's gallery straddled the centre of the bridge, providing a clearance of 16 feet for the traffic below; the wooden octagonal control box was added to the gantry in 1880. Subsequent to the bridge being replaced with a fixed bridge in 1966, this gantry was salvaged and after restoration was placed in the carpark at the Port Dock Markets, Nile Street.</p>  <p>The central swinging section posed several problems for the inhabitants of Lefevre Peninsula as the bridge carried the water pipeline and the gas lines. These problems were solved with the building of the Semaphore water tower and a gasometer at Peterhead. By the 1960s this bridge was deteriorating and the decision was made to replace it with a re-inforced, prestressed concrete bridge. As there was now no demand for access by shipping to the Old Port Reach, the new bridge was a fixed bridge, and carried road traffic only. Rail services were carried by a bridge built further up the river in 1916.</p>  </div></div>",,-34.78,138.44,Photograph,,,,,NULL

Operated by J H Murch and his family it was a double-ended kerosene powered vessel. Fares were a penny (equivalent to a cent) for adults and a halfpenny for children. Initially licensed to carry 120 passengers this was later reduced to 60. By the mid 1930s demand had dropped from 650 monthly tickets to just 68; strikes and the Depression affected demand as did the motor bus service which crossed the Jervois Bridge.

It had been found that Port Elliott, the terminus for the River Murray paddle steamer trade, was unsuitable. The railway line was extended to Victor Harbor and work commenced on building a jetty and pier. This was subsequently extended right across to Granite Island and a wharf built alongside the island.

Light was sent to England at the age of six for his schooling. He enlisted in the British Navy in 1799 and served for two years. Light travelled extensively in Europe and India and then in 1808 Light purchased a commission in the 4<sup>th</sup> Dragoons of the British Army, fighting with merit in the Peninsular War. He left the army in 1821 and throughout the next decade lived primarily on the continent where his experiences included serving in the Spanish revolutionary army, sailing his boat the <em>Gulnare</em> throughout the Mediterranean and honing his artistic skills. He had two books of sketches published; <em>Sicilian Scenery</em> (1823) and <em>Views of Pompeii</em> (1828).</p>  <p>Light was put forward as a candidate for the governorship of South Australia, but was eventually appointed surveyor-general of South Australia in 1836.

There was some opposition to the choice of location for Adelaide (the colony's first governor John Hindmarsh was a vocal opponent, preferring Encounter Bay or Port Lincoln) but Light and Kingston persevered.</p>  <p>In December 1837, Light realised the amount of work he faced to survey the country sections of South Australia was enormous. He applied to the Colonization Commissioners for assistance and was instructed to conduct a temporary 'running survey' rather than a full trigonometric survey. Light, and most of his staff, resigned in protest. Light went on to establish a private surveying firm. He had been plagued with respiratory problems for much of his life and died of tuberculosis on 6 October 1839. His body was buried in Light Square, Adelaide.

The ketch once fully loaded would probably have sailed directly back across the gulf to Port Adelaide and transhipped the cargo there, or have sailed along the peninsula to one of the larger ports such as Ardrossan or Edithburgh and offloaded to a larger ship.</div>  <div>Before bulk handling facilities were built during the late 1950s and 1960s at the larger ports, transport by ketches, loaded at the small ports was the usual means of transport for the harvest. The bags would be laboriously man-handled on to wagons or trucks, driven to the harbour and then man-handled into the ketches hold. On arriving at its destination the ketch hands would then off load the bags, sometimes with the benefit of a small sling which carried 4-5 bages at a time, or else laboriously a bag at a time on their own backs.</div>  <div>The installation of bulk handling facilities and improved road transport meant that the harvest could be driven directly to the silos and loaded into the ships' holds by conveyor belt.</div>  </div></div>",,-34.57,137.88,Photograph,,,,1919-1927,NULL

Port Wakefield was the first port established outside of Port Adelaide and was created because of the copper boom at Kapunda and Burra in the 1840s.</p>  <p>The port was officially proclaimed 12 September 1850: basic facilities were rapidly established. Prior to its proclamation Port Wakefield had already trans-shipped 6,000 tons of coal, and 1,156 tons of copper as the mine owners sought the quickest and cheapest method of getting their ore to the world market.</p>  <p>Railways were built and took the copper trade away from the port. However Port Wakefield found a new product to ship: wool and later wheat. In 1866 the port was second only to Port Adelaide in its wool exports, exporting over 3,300,000 pounds of wool. As the land inland from the port was farmed and agricultural production increased with the use of fertilizers the wharfs of Port Wakefield became stacked high with sacks of wheat waiting for shipment.</p>  <p>The ketches of the mosquito fleet carried the grain to the large ships anchored in deep water, or directly to Port Adelaide. In 1909, 300,000 bags of wheat were exported. But Port Wakefield's heyday had passed. The railways were cheaper and more efficient, allowing farmers to cart their wheat and wool to nearby railheads or sidings.</p>  </div></div>",,-34.18,138.14,Photograph,,,,1884-1913,NULL

The men who did this heavy, dusty work were usually referred to as 'lumpers'. The grain was bagged in the paddocks and each bag weighed 3 bushels or 72 kilograms.</p>  <p>Port Broughton operated as a port from 1871. The first jetty was built in 1873, but was replaced in 1877, at the same time as the harbour was dredged. Jetty extensions were made in 1890 with the 'T-head' being extended so that two vessels could be worked simultaneously. The jetty was extensively repaired in the 1950s and is used by Spencer Gulf prawn ships.

The first ship to take any of the grain harvest back to Europe loaded at the port 13 months later. The jetty was extended in 1883 with an L-shaped extension which provided shelter for the small vessels which frequented the port. Port Victoria is not a deep water port and the large ships needed to anchor offshore and were loaded from ketches and other small craft.</p>  <p>The town grew rapidly and by the mid 1880s three grain agents had offices in the town. Port Victoria was one of the largest ports in the colony in the late 19th century and was also one of the main ports for the export of the Yorke Peninsula grain harvest.</p>  <p>The grain was bagged at the farm and brought down to the port by wagon and later truck. Here they were checked by the grain agent and stored in great stacks. Every bag was handled manually. One stack could hold up to 23,000 bags. From the stacks the bags were transferred to carts for transporting to the ketches moored at the end of the jetty. These then carried the grain to the ships offshore. As the ketches held approximately only 3,000 bags it would take many trips to fill the vast holds of the largest ships which could carry up to 50,000 bags.</p>  <p>The harbour dues in Port Victoria were low because there was no berthing at the jetty. The large ships stayed out in deep water and relied on the ketch trade to fill their holds. This was one of the reasons Port Victoria remained popular so long with the large sailing ships. In 1949 the last of these vessels loaded at the port: <em>Pamir</em> and <em>Passat</em>. Bulk handling facilities established in the late 1950s at Wallaroo and Ardrossan meant the end of Port Victoria as a shipping port.</p>  </div></div>",,-34.46,137.45,Photograph,,,,1927-1939,NULL

Pine Point attracted settlers well in advance of the proclamation of Muloowurtie in 1874. The name reverted to Pine Point in 1940. Sheep were overlanded from the eastern side of the Gulf and where the mallee scrub was too thick for their passage, they were moved along the beach at Black Point at low tide. The first flock arrived in 1846.</p>  <p>As the scrub was rolled the land was opened up and dams and tanks were excavated. When these dried over the summer months, water was carted from wells at Pine Point. Later agriculture arrived on the peninsula and Pine Point became one of the many small ports where the ketches could pull in and be loaded directly from the drays. A chute or slide was installed in 1927, which greatly facilitated the loading.</p>  <p>In October 1967 the ketch <em>Yongala</em> took the last cargo of grain off from Pine Point, sailing across the Gulf to Port Adelaide.

The ketch once fully loaded sailed directly back across the gulf to Port Adelaide and transhipped the cargo there, or alternatively sailed along the peninsula to one of the larger ports such as Ardrossan or Edithburgh and offloaded to a larger ship.</p>  <p>Before bulk handling facilities were built during the late 1950s and 1960s at the larger ports, transport by ketches, loaded at the small ports was the usual means of transport for the harvest. The bags would be laboriously man-handled on to wagons or trucks, driven to the harbour and then man-handled into the ketche's hold. On arriving at its destination the ketch hands would then off load the bags, sometimes with the benefit of a small sling which carried 4-5 bags at a time, or else laboriously a bag at a time on their own backs.</p>  <p>At Pine Point, initially the drays were driven out to the ketches at low tide and the bagged grain loaded directly to the ketch. Later a small wharf was built which enabled the ketch to remain in deeper water. Finally in 1927 a slide or chute down the embankment enabled speedier loading. The last ketch to take off grain from Pine Point was the <em>Yongala</em> in October 1967; the grain yards at Pine Point were also closed at this time.</p>  <p>The installation of bulk handling facilities at Ardrossan and Port Giles and improved road transport meant that the harvest could be driven directly to the silos and loaded into the ships' holds by conveyor belt.</p>  </div></div>",,-34.57,137.88,Photograph,,,,,NULL

Built on Allotment 1 opposite the jetty it was always intended as a site for a hotel, and building commenced in early November 1877 following the sale of the town allotments in September. Mr George Selth was the owner of the hotel but the licencee was Mr Laurie Driver. Originally called the Port Vincent Hotel the name was changed in 1912 to the Ventnor Hotel after the home town of the new licencee Mrs Clara Ponder who came from Ventnor on the Isle of Wight. Extensions were made to the hotel in 1926, adding another 12 bedrooms and two bathrooms. In 1956 a beer garden was added, and in 1959 another major alteration was made. The pepper tree just visible to the left was removed in 1937.</p>  <p>The original store in Port Vincent closed in 1882 and for a number of years the town had no store. In 1903 the Harris family settled in Port Vincent; Mr Harris was the jetty toll collector but the income from this was insufficient to support the family and he undertook a number of other jobs including blacksmithing and with his wife opened a general store and tearoom in a rented building on the allotment behind the hotel. Cake and biscuits were home-made and the tearooms were well patronized on the day the steamer came in with supplies. The store carried groceries, fruit and vegetables and drapery and supplied not only the townspeople but the surrounding farms. The Harris' sold the tearooms in 1913 to James Disher.</p>  <p>A grain store was erected by Joseph Parsons in the late 1880s or 1890s on the inland corner of the same town block that the hotel occupied. It was built of stone and had a high gable roof. Parsons used the store to house his own bagged wheat from his farm near Curramulka as well as other material he exported including wool and mallee stumps. He arranged his own shipments directly with the Adelaide grain merchants. Parsons ceased using it as a grain store from about 1903 and it has had a variety of uses since then including general store, church, bank, post office and art gallery. It continues to be known as the Grain Store. A residence was added to the building in 1907 and the front gable of this is just visible to the left of the high Grain Store gable.</p>  </div></div>",,-34.77,137.85,Photograph,,,,,NULL

As the size and frequency of ships visiting the port with cargo and passengers increased the need grew for a jetty which provided greater depth of water at low tide.</p>  <p>The new jetty was only 3 metres longer at 308 metres, and the last 45 metres widened out to 4.5 metres from the 2.7 metres of the bulk of the length. It gave a depth of just over 2 metres at low water enabling larger vessels to moor at the jetty. This new jetty was opened 13 July 1905. A chute was built down from the cliff above the jetty to bring the bagged grain down from the stacks located on the clifftop.</p>  <p>The first jetty remained in use for some years as a recreational jetty until finally it was removed after being used for target practice by the military during World War II. The jetty ceased to be used for commercial trade during the 1960s, as bulk handling facilities became operational at Port Giles to the south.</p>  </div></div>",,-34.91,137.79,Photograph,,,,,NULL

I was born at Warooka on York [sic] Peninsula on September 1<sup>st</sup> 1886. Warooka in those days was a very small town we lived some nine miles from Warooka at a place called Para Wurlie, there was only a few families living there, scattered farmers. There was a very small school at the time. There had to be an attendance of not less than twelve children to keep it open, that was how I went to school at five years of age. The school was two and a half miles from our home thus the round trip was five miles for five days a week not bad for a five year old. We lived on what was known as Harwood Station in those days. That has all been altered many years since Harwood Station was owned by Mr. Henry R Fuller a former mayor of Adelaide, who has the distinction of being the first mayor of Adelaide to entertain a member of the Royal Family a former Duke of Edinburg [sic]. Ebenezer Ward was also interested in the property. Ebenezer Ward was a very well known politician of those days. The Station Home where we lived was a very large house. Twelve large and lofty rooms it had very high foundation with a verandah right around the whole building. It also had a very large Hall or Banquet room for Entertainment a stage for a piano. The families of the district would gather for parties, dances and other social events. Mr. William Fuller son of the owner was living in another large house about one and half miles away at the head Station. Bert Fuller another son was living there also. There was some grand old families living in the district such as the Players, Hammills, Geaters (?), Youngs, Grabias (?), Cadds, Barretts and so on. I will always remember Mr. Trehearne storekeeper from Minlaton who used to go around to all the farmers driving his old two horse van. Also the little town of Warooka with its little Post Office kept by the Misses Crofts, the Chemist kept by Mr. Keightley the hotel kept by the one and only David Ramsay. Mrs. Baker also kept a store.

Failing health led to his retirement in 1898, at which point his son, (Henry) Lipson Hancock took over as manager. Both men were active in the Methodist Church. Lipson Hancock was born at Moonta on 5 March 1867 and educated at Prince Alfred College and the School of Mines, Ballarat. In 1887 he came back to Moonta as mining engineer and surveyor.

However it found a new lease of life in the shipment of wheat and wool from the port. At one time Port Wakefield was the busiest port in the state outside of Port Adelaide. 300,000 bags of wheat were shipped through the port in 1909. As the surrounding countryside was opened up for development and agriculture its importance grew.

Wheat flowed into Port Wakefield for trans-shipment. When the railway was opened from Port Wakefield to Kadina in 1878, wheat was freighted directed to the deep water port of Wallaroo. From here the wheat could go direct to ports in Europe or elsewhere in Australia without the need to be transferred from the ketches to large vessels at Port Adelaide.</p>  </div></div>",,-34.18,138.14,Photograph,,,,,NULL

The Wallaroo Mining Company (later the Wallaroo and Moonta Mining and Smelting Company) established a smelter adjacent to the port facilities. Here it produced matte copper (approximately 50% copper with residual sulphides) which was exported for further processing along with copper ore. The first furnace built utilised the Welsh reverberatory process. Its large square chimney, known as the Hughes stack after the mine's founder/owner Walter Watson Hughes, used 300,000 firebricks in its construction. Hughes' initials and the date 1861 were laid into one side of the stack.</p> <p>More chimney stacks were added at the site to serve other furnaces. Only seven years after its establishment Wallaroo Smelters was described as the largest in the world, but there would be further expansion and modernisation over the next 50 years of its operations.</p> <p>In 1890 a period of diversification was ushered in: new technology resulted in greater efficiency and production. The copper sulphides were dealt with more effectively and a more highly refined copper product became possible. In addition, silver-lead ores from Broken Hill and gold from Kalgoorlie were being processed. The proliferation of chimneys grew.</p> <p>The third phase in the development of the smelters began in 1909 when copper converters were imported from the United States: these resulted in further efficiencies and energy savings. The operation had progressed a long way from the Welsh processes used when the smelters first opened.</p> <p>By 1918 the Wallaroo/Moonta mines were struggling because the ore was running out. Finally copper production became irregular as the mines produced less. Industrial disputes resulted in closures at the smelters, the price of copper fell until it was costing more to produce the ore than it could be sold for. The Company shareholders made the decision to close the mines and the smelters. They also authorised the demolition of the sites to recoup money from the sale of equipment.</p> <p>From left to right the stacks are: lead works, gold works, Wallaroo Superphosphate Manure Company's stack, Hughes stack, Office Refinery stack and Assay Office stack.</p>  </div></div>",,-33.93,137.62,Photograph,,,,,NULL

Although the Assay Office building still stands, its stack has been demolished.</p> <p>The smelters were established on the shores of the gulf in 1861, two years after the discovery of copper at Wallaroo. A jetty was built to enable the loading of copper ore and later copper ingots from the mines and smelter. The Hughes chimney, the first furnace/chimney built on the site, utilised the Welsh reverberatory method; many furnaces and their flues were connected to this stack.</p> <p>A short seven years after its inception the site was described as the largest copper smelter in the world; more furnaces and their chimneys were built. Improvements in technology were made in three phases at the works, until by 1910 it had changed completely from the original Welsh process to the latest and most efficient methods from the United States. A major development was to set up a copper sulphate plant which treated the waste sulphur dioxide gas and flue deposits. Lead smelting works were added to treat Broken Hill and Tasmanian ores.</p> <p>With the reduction in copper extracted from the mines, and a sharp fall in the price of copper after World War I, the decision was reached by the shareholders to close the mines and the smelters.

In all, four processes took place with a huge consumption of fuel - locally grown firewood or imported coal and coke. New technology was introduced from 1890 which streamlined these processes: it was at this stage that the sulphur laden flue gases began to be processed to manufacture sulphuric acid for the manufacture of superphosphate.

Two years later copper was found at nearby Moonta.</p> <p>The mine at Wallaroo developed quickly and, with copper selling for 115 pounds a ton, was very prosperous. Hughes established smelting works on the nearby coast and the town of Wallaroo was proclaimed in 1861. Up to 1889 the value of ores sold from the Wallaroo mines was nearly 2.25 million pounds.</p> <p>Then in 1889 the mines at Moonta combined with the Wallaroo operations and the Wallaroo and Moonta Mining and Smelting Company was created. The manager of this extended company was Henry Lipson Hancock. By 1905 the company employed over 2,200 people and this boom period continued until World War I when the price of copper dropped significantly. By 1923 several years of losses had been made and the shareholders decided to wind up the company. Ore production from the two mines in the period 1859 to 1923 was 6.5 million tons, producing 330,000 tons of copper valued at over 20 million pounds.</p> <p>The shareholders decided that most of the mines' equipment should be sold off to recoup some further profits. The huge mining structures disappeared from the landscape, with only a few tumbled ruins remaining.</p> <p>This photograph shows only a portion of the Wallaroo site: the Office shaft poppet head stands to the right with the winding engine house the white building behind it.</p>  </div></div>",,-33.93,137.62,Photograph,,,,,NULL

Front row: A J (Bob) Hodgeman, Mawson and Morton Moyes.</p> <p>The photograph is most likely to have been taken in 1911 prior to the departure of the expedition. All the men in this photo were South Australian with the exception of Frank Bickerton, who was British. Bickerton was the expedition's mechanical engineer and was responsible for the aeroplane (air tractor) and the wireless equipment. Both of these were innovative with Mawson pioneering their use in the Antarctic. The wireless was more successful than the aeroplane which was converted to an air tractor for pulling sledges after an accident in Adelaide damaged it for its primary purpose of flight. In addition to his mechanical duties Bickerton would lead the Western Sledging party. This explored some 160 miles (approximately 260 kilometres) of coastline and retrieved the first meteorite discovered in Antarctica.</p> <p>Percy Correll joined Mawson's expedition as a mechanic and assistant physicist. He turned his hand to anything however: equipped with a lathe and other essential equipment he made constant repairs to instruments including tide guages and the sledges. He later assisted Frank Hurley with the photography. Early in the expedition Correll was the first, and last, of the men to voluntarily attempt a swim in the waters of Cape Denison. He accompanied Cecil Madigan and Archibald McLean on the Eastern Sledging journey. Correll Nunatak is named after him. (A nunatak is an exposed peak rising above the snow and ice field, and is a highly visible landmark.)</p> <p>A J (Bob) Hodgeman was the expedition's cartographer and an artist. He was also an architect and had designed the expedition's huts and oversaw their erection. He was a member of the Near Eastern party which surveyed the coast between the main base at Cape Denison and the Mertz Glacier Tongue.</p> <p>Morton Moyes served with Frank Wild's Western party, working as the meteorologist. Most notably he endured nine weeks alone at the base as the rest of the party were exploring in two parties. This experience did not prevent him from returning to Antarctic work: he joined John King Davis in the rescue of Shackleton's Ross Sea party in 1916 and worked with Mawson on the British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE) in 1929. Away from the Antarctic Moyes was a navigation instructor with the Royal Australian Navy.</p> <p>Cecil Madigan had his Rhodes Scholarship deferred so that he could join Douglas Mawson's Australasian Antarctic Expedition as meteorologist. In addition to these duties, Madigan led a sledging expedition, the Eastern Journey, which examined and surveyed the coast of Adelie Land. Some 400 kilometres of coast was surveyed. Madigan Nunatak, east of the base and a prominent landmark, was named after him.</p> <p>Madigan, Bickerton and Hodgeman were three of the men who agreed to stay in Adelie Land into a second year to search for Mawson's missing party. In the event they were not needed as Mawson managed to reach the base unaided, with his tragic tale of the loss of Mertz and Ninnis. The ship <em>Aurora,</em> however, was unable to get back to collect them and so a second enforced winter in the Antarctic followed anyway.</p> </div></div>",,-34.93,138.59,Photograph,,,,,NULL

The total of funds on this list is 2,249 pounds and sixpence.</p> <p>The SS <em>Admella</em> was an iron hulled ship which was on its way from Adelaide to Melbourne when it hit a reef off South Australia's southern coastline on Saturday 6 August 1859. It took several days for two seamen who had made it to shore to then walk the 20 miles to the Cape Northumberland lighthouse.  The lighthouse keeper borrowed a horse and rode to Mt Gambier to raise the alarm.  Information then had to be telegraphed to Adelaide and Portland, Victoria.  Two rescue boats were sent out, the <em>Corio</em> from Adelaide and the <em>Ladybird</em> from Portland. The <em>Corio</em> wasn't able to reach the wreckage until Wednesday of that week.  Twenty survivors were still clinging to the wreckage. Most of the <em>Admella's</em> passengers and crew had already drowned in the heavy seas or died of thirst or exhaustion.</p> <p>It took another three days, eight days after the shipwreck, for the lifeboat, <em>Portland,</em> working with the <em>Ladybird, to</em> crash through the heavy seas to complete the rescue. Repeated attempts  by the two larger ships had failed. In total, 89 lives were lost, including several of the rescuers. Women, men and children died. Families were destroyed. Working men lost the tools of trade, which also meant the loss of their livelihoods. </p> <p>Following the establishment of the first <em>Admella</em> Relief Fund on 27 August 1859, other communities throughout South Australia and Victoria established committees to raise money to assist the survivors and reward their rescuers. Money was collected in churches and in pubs, through District Councils and through responsible individuals. Sums donated ranged from 10 pounds to several of just one shilling. People gave what they could afford. All of the survivors received varying degrees of assistance from the fund.</p> <p>Among the rescuers, the Portland lifeboat crew were rewarded as follows: Captain Fawthrop received a gold medal and 100 pounds; Coxswain W Rosevear recieved a silver medal and 50 pounds; and the 13 crew were given medals and amounts ranging between 12 pounds 10 shillings and 25 pounds.</p> <p>A positive result of the wreck of the <em>Admella</em> was the rapid establishment of a lifeboat service in South Australia.</p> </div></div>",,-34.93,138.59,Newspaper,John Stephens,Adelaide,,1852-1883,NULL

One contributor to the <em>Maitland Watch</em> labelled the postal arrangement of the town, 'a standing disgrace,' and added that the people of Maitland were, 'sick and tired of antiquated methods'. By 1912 this dissatisfaction led to the announcement of a new Post Office, which was built at 31 Robert Street, and opened in May 1914.<br/> <br/> That building, as depicted here in 1932, is still home to the Maitland branch of Australia Post .</p></div>",,-34.37,137.67,Photograph,,,,1927-1939,NULL

As the town grew, these rooms were no longer able to meet the needs of the townspeople, and so in 1872 a plan was hatched to build an Institute, a place where locals could come together to pursue intellectual and cultural interests. A Board of Trustees was appointed, and Samuel Rogers offered a half acre site in Robert Street which was accepted by the Board. Money was raised via a subscription list, the staging of concerts, and through government grants. The foundation stone was laid in January of 1882, and the hall completion celebrated in October of the same year.<br/> <br/> Whilst there was praise for the building's interior, its fa ade was not met with such enthusiasm. One visiting parliamentarian remarked  that appreciation of the building could be likened to, 'how a man might estimate his wife or sweetheart - externally unattractive but internally beautiful.' A new fa ade was commissioned and opened in January 1884.<br/> <br/> Over the years the Institute was home to a circulating library, concerts, lectures, plays, and even a roller skating rink. After Maitland's town hall was damaged in 1953, the Institute was remodelled to take over some of its functions, incorporating a ballroom, auditorium and meeting rooms. A further remodelling in 1999 expanded some of the spaces and added an industrial kitchen. </div></div>",,-34.37,137.67,Photograph,,,,1927-1939,NULL

Members of the Josephite Order took a vow of poverty and dedicated themselves to educating poor children.  <p>In 1867, Bishop Shiel asked Mary to start a school in Adelaide. From there, the Sisters' work extended to further South Australian settlements, and other locations around Australia and also in New Zealand.

Re-building of the old wharves became necessary.</p>  <p>This allowed modernisation as well: concrete wharfs were built: Number 1 Quay was the first to be modernised, and was completed in 1929, followed by Ocean Steamers wharf a few years later.

Made entirely of reinforced concrete but with wooden fenders added to reduce the impact on ships tying up to the wharf, it was considered particularly strong. Each pile weighed 6 tons, was 45 feet long and 48 inches square; the piles were driven 20 feet deep. At the same time the anchorage was deepened to 22 feet at low water.</p>  <p>Many wharves in Port Adelaide were privately owned prior to the resumption of all wharves by the government from 1916 and were generally known by the company name or by the type of vessel using the wharf.

Early explorers such as Hume and Hovell, then Charles Sturt, and various <a href=/site/page.cfm?u=61&amp;c=3968>overlanding parties</a> all faced this problem. They generally converted their drays to temporary punts in order to cross. Punts or ferries were used at many points along the river, and still are today. As traffic across the river increased, so did the need for bridges.</p> <p>In 1864 it was proposed that a bridge be built across the River Murray in South Australia. The decision was driven by growing trade with the South East of the colony and later with Melbourne. The movement of stock to and from the rich grazing lands in the South East was impeded by the river. Animals were lost at considerable cost to their owners. It was decided by a parliamentary Select Committee to build a bridge at Edwards Crossing. The Government Surveyor took depth soundings at various suggested locations including Wellington where a ferry still operates today. Edwards Crossing was selected because the estimated costs for a bridge were cheapest there.</p> <p>A Warren girder bridge costing 9500 pounds was ordered from England in September 1866 and arrived in early 1868. It went into storage at Dry Creek while debate over the site continued for many more years. Construction of the first South Australian bridge over the River Murray finally began in 1873.</p> <p>As only the bridge span had been ordered from England, the costs of bridge foundations, supports and approaches had not been accounted for and so the construction budget had blown out before work even began. A year later the engineer was advised that this road bridge would in future have to also carry a railway as part of the inter-colonial network. Despite this and other difficulties, construction was finally completed in March 1879 at a cost of 130 thousand pounds. Bridge traffic had a speed limit of 25 miles per hour (40 kph). From 1886 it carried the railway as well. Road traffic stopped when a train was crossing.</p> <p>Edwards Crossing became the town of Murray Bridge in 1924. The increasing weight of railway rolling stock meant that a separate rail bridge had to be built.  This was completed in 1925. Road traffic continued to use the original bridge. In 1979 a new road bridge was built five kilometres downstream at Swanport, linking to the South Eastern Freeway through the Adelaide Hills.</p></div>",,-35.11,139.27,Photograph,,,,1852-1883,NULL

Towns were to be established at approximately 10 mile intervals as this was considered a reasonable travelling distance for the times. However local conditions, such as the availability of water, could also influence a location. Once a site was selected the surveyors would receive a town plan from the Surveyor-General in Adelaide. This was generally of the regular grid pattern that Colonel Light had used when he designed Adelaide and always contained allowance, as in Adelaide, for a belt of parkland surrounding the town. These could then be developed for sporting facilities, schools and other facilities as required.</p> <p>Arthurton was probably intended as a large regional centre, if the number of blocks and open spaces originally surveyed are taken into account. Over the years unreliable water supply and drought have affected regional agricultural activity, and the economic consequences of this influenced the town's eventual size.</p>  </div></div>",,-34.26,137.75,Map,Surveyor General&apos;s Office,Adelaide,"Crawford, Frazer S.

The jetty was completed in March 1879 and was 400 feet long (122 metres) with 11 feet of water at the end at low tide. A survey of the harbour was also undertaken, providing information for ships' captains about the safest approach to the jetty and shore. Shipping was quick to use the improved facilities over the beach landing: ketches and small steamers brought in supplies such as stores, fencing wire, and wheat bags, and carried away the filled sacks after the grain harvest. This would either be taken to a larger Peninsula port such as Port Victoria or Wallaroo, or to Port Adelaide.</p> <p>The Hundred of Koolywurtie for which Port Rickaby provided the main access point for many years was farm land, with an average yield of grain for the six years 1877-1882 of 5 bushels 57 pounds. A harbour master was appointed in 1899 and a load limit set for the jetty due to previous incidents of gross overloading. The small port was busy for many years carrying away the grain harvest which increased after the introduction of superphosphate, which greatly increased the productivity of the soil, in the late 19th century. The main carriers were the ketches of the <a href=page.cfm?u=626 target=_blank title=mosquito fleet>mosquito fleet</a>, ferrying the wheat sacks up the coast to the larger ports. However by the 1950s bulk carriers were loading the wheat and barley: the days of the small ports were over.

A lightship was moored over this and finally in 1877 a permanent lighthouse was built on the reef. It was also noted on the charts that there was a magnetic disturbance in Spencer Gulf - this was related to the large iron ore deposits on the western side of the Gulf at Iron Knob. This chart shows the multitude of soundings that enabled ships' captains and pilots to safely navigate the channel. The enormous Hughes chimney stack at the Wallaroo Smelters remained standing after the closure of the smelters in 1923 as it had always served as a daytime navigation marker.</p> <p>Early in the port's history small coasting vessels brought explosives for the mines, timber for jetties and the mines, coal, potatoes and later superphosphate for the farms. Outwards goods included flour, wool and hides, as well as copper from the mines at Wallaroo and Kadina. In 1880 another jetty was built and it was extended in 1902. This jetty accommodated the large sailing ships that loaded 29,000-30,000 bags of wheat at a time. By the end of the 20th century steamships were increasingly active in the port and Gulf - these carried copper ingots to Port Adelaide for trans-shipment. After the copper mines closed in 1923 as the ore ran out, Wallaroo fell back on its other great export, wheat.</p> <p>After World War Two further expansion ensured Wallaroo's future. Another jetty had been built in 1926 and in 1958 a conveyor belt for bulk handling was added to this and the first block of grain silos was built on the shore. The size of the grain carriers increased dramatically. In 1967 MV <em>Pontos</em> loaded 29,317 tons of wheat at 430.7 tons per hour - a record for the time. The dredging of a channel assisted in allowing these huge vessels to come into port. In 1874 Wallaroo had been proud to proclaim itself the second port in South Australia, beaten only by Port Adelaide. Over a century later, its main trade changed from copper to wheat, it still ranks among the seven major ports controlled by <a href=http://www.flindersports.com.au/ target=_blank title=Flinders Ports>Flinders Ports</a> and during 2005/06 0.463 million tons of cargo was handled at Wallaroo.</p> <p>From December 2006, a passenger ferry operated by <a href=http://www.seasa.com.au/ target=_blank title=Sea SA>Sea SA</a> has sailed from Wallaroo to Lucky Bay (near Cowell) on Eyre Peninsula.

Bird's-eye views gave a perspective of a city as if from the air. Some were drawn from tethered balloons; alternatively a high church steeple or other vantage point would be used. Bird's-eye views became popular in Europe and America during the mid to late 19th century, and the idea was followed in Australia as well.</p> <p>Points of note are the Newmarket Hotel, at the corner of North and West Terraces, with the stockyard opposite; Holy Trinity and Scots Churches on North Terrace, the South Australian Institute and the new Exhibition buildings also on North Terrace. Note the cliffs along the River Torrens, which are now terraced gardens. The Elder Park Rotunda, built in 1882, can be seen adjacent to the City or Adelaide Bridge. In Light Square the original sandstone monument erected in memory to Colonel William Light in 1844 still stands.

In 1876 they acquired a long term lease on premises in King William Street and re-located there.

From September 1859 it was illuminated by gas (presumably from its own gas plant as reticulated gas was not available in Adelaide until June 1863).</p> <p>The Assembly Rooms actually opened several days previously on 26 June for a grand Masonic Ball and, as mentioned on the programme for the public opening on the 30th, the Freemasons were happy to allow their decorations to remain in place. Rather than a theatre for stage productions White's was 'more suited to concert party technique, to specialty troupes like bellringers, to solo artists ... and to family troupes of actors, singers and instrumentalists...' (Fischer, p. 87). Minstrel shows were also staged there and the Assembly Rooms had a tradition of staging variety shows well into the vaudeville period of the early 20th century.</p> <p>In 1865 there was a proposal to enlarge the Assembly Rooms to seat 1,500 people but nothing came of this.</p> <p>White's closed in 1880, but the site continued as an entertainment venue, with a re-modelling which included a dress circle and some private boxes.

Then with the passing of the South Australian Education Act of 1875 it became compulsory for children between the ages of seven and 13 years to attend school. At the same time the government's Council of Education began the lengthy process of building schools and also of examining and supervising the private schools some of which were closed down. The Moonta Model School was built in 1877, opened for students in October of the same year, and officially opened 4 February 1878 by Hon. Neville Blyth, Minister of Education. The Moonta Mines Model School opened the following year. Secondary schooling was provided at Moonta from 1907 operating from a classroom at the Primary(Model) School, continuing there until a separate high school was opened in 1910.

Uda adds that the school at the Mines was opened the following year. He also notes that before these new school buildings were opened there were 'several small [schools] in the district ... (including East Moonta) four, if not more, at Moonta Mines, and two or three elsewhere. Some adjoining chapels and others mud built.' He then continues with his recollections of lessons, the recitation to the teacher of a previously marked and memorised passage from a grammar, history, geography or spelling book.

Postcards were immensely popular especially in an era when photography was an expensive hobby. The cards had attractive images and provided the space for a brief message, as on this card where a fond grandmother sends a card to her granddaughter holidaying at Port Elliot on the south coast.

The church remains in use, looking down upon the village built in the loop of the river called the Horseshoe Bend. Before the bridge was built across the river, a ford below the hill was the crossing point. It seems to be this viewpoint that Wood has used for his painting.</p> <p>Noarlunga was founded in 1841 after land was offered for sale by the South Australian Company. Once the dense wattle and peppermint scrub was cleared, sheep and cattle could be grazed and crops planted. A flour mill was built several years later and the bags of flour taken downstream by barge to vessels waiting at Port Noarlunga. Renamed Old Noarlunga in 1978 after it was by-passed by the new South Road, the town has retained much of its original character, despite now being an outer suburb of Adelaide.</p></div>",,-35.18,138.5,Artwork,,,,,NULL

The railway is now known as the old Ghan that ran from Port Augusta via Quorn, Hawker, Parachilna, Copley, Farina, Marree, Curdimurka, William Creek and Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. Construction of this narrow gauge line started in 1878. The old Ghan line was used for the last time in October 1980.</p> <p>William Creek is half way between Marree and Oodnadatta and halfway from Adelaide to Alice Springs. It has always been a tiny settlement. Even at its peak before the Ghan line was moved further west in 1980 there were only a few cottages, a small school and a hotel/store. It is South Australia's smallest town with a population of around 10 and is surrounded by Australia's spatially largest cattle property, Anna Creek Station which covers an area of 23,800 sq km or almost half the size of Tasmania.</p> <p>The William Creek Hotel was built in 1887 to service the Great Northern Railway and now has an almost legendary status as the only 'watering hole' on the Oodnadatta Track between Marree and Oodnadatta. The William Creek pub is the only iron hotel left trading in South Australia. As an original pub it provides a rare insight into an aspect of outback history and is filled with unique mementoes left by thousands of visitors.</p> <p>Camels and cameleers were an important part of the development of the outback, and camel racing lives on at William Creek today. Nearby Lake Eyre is another attraction.</p></div>",,-28.9,136.34,Artwork,,,,,NULL

The community received no financial support, and building materials were very difficult to come by. As a result, homes were made with whatever could be found; mud, stones, flattened kerosene tins, and in a few instances, pine.</p> <p>Fred Eaton, a carpenter by trade was instrumental in building many of them, and in teaching the Adnyamathanha how to build, and make furniture.</p> <p>Mountford seemed impressed with their construction, commenting, '<em>the</em> <em>houses which had been built by the inhabitants after a European pattern were well constructed</em>.' PRG 1218/8/1 p. 31.</p> <p>These crude structures, without sinks or cupboards, without verandas or gutters, were the only houses available to Mission residents until 1959, when eight new cottages were erected. However, this did little to solve the community's overcrowding and sanitation issues, and it was during the 1960s that Nepabunna residents started to request a Government take-over, releasing them from the control of the cash-strapped United Aborigines Mission. This eventually came to fruition in 1973, and the original, inadequate, housing was replaced.</p> <p>Second image is a close-up of a stone hut with a pressed kerosene roof.</p></div>",,-30.58,138.97,Photograph,,,,1927-1939,NULL

He and his wife were involved in the United Aborigines Mission children's home in Oodnadatta, and then together with Jim Page, they established the Nepabunna Mission in 1931.</p> <p>After the death of Page in 1935, the Eatons continued to oversee the Mission. Under the structure of the settlement, the Missionaries had total power over its administration, and the lives of the residents. With support from a small staff, the Mission administered medical care, ration distribution, educational services, and the general store.</p> <p>Its primary aim however, was to convert the residents to Christianity. To this end, Eaton was strongly opposed to the continuation of Adnyamathanha initiation rites, and campaigned for their cessation. This caused unease in his relationship with Mountford, who was of course keen to witness such rites during his time in Nepabunna, and actively encouraged a ceremony to take place. 'There was a mutual dislike between Eaton and Mountford, and strong moral dissaproval on both sides.' (Brock, 1993, p. 149) Eaton was successful however, and initiation ceremonies had ceased by the time he left the Mission in the early 1950s.</p> <p>According to the book <em>Yura and Udnyu</em> he is remembered as 'a humane man who fought hard for their rights, although in a paternalistic way.' (p. 50) He was an advocate for equal pay, and for improved medical care and education for Aboriginal people.</p></div>",,-30.58,138.97,Photograph,,,,1927-1939,NULL

His sketches and paintings of the landscape, the flora, fauna and Aboriginal people of South Australia, and of the streets, buildings, people, way of life and notable events of Adelaide are of some artistic and great historical interest.</p> <p>Born in Norwich, Skipper joined the East India Company as a young man and served on the <em>Sherbourne</em> (ship). Skipper was interested in art from an early age and was encouraged by his uncle James Stark, a noted landscape painter. During his time at sea Skipper kept a journal which he illustrated with sketches. In 1836 he immigrated to South Australia, arriving on the <em>Africaine</em> (ship) 6 November. On the voyage Skipper met Frances Thomas, whose father Robert was to establish South Australia's first newspaper, the <em><a href=/site/page.cfm?u=519&amp;c=2564>South Australian gazette and colonial register</a></em>. They married in December 1839.</p> <p>In South Australia Skipper commenced his legal career and was articled to Charles Mann the Advocate-General and Crown Solicitor of South Australia and later worked with EC Gwynne. Skipper was admitted as an attorney and proctor of the South Australian Supreme Court in March 1840 and served as clerk of the Local Court of Port Adelaide from 1852-1872. He continued his artistic pursuits however, and sketched many scenes depicting the early years of European settlement in South Australia. Skipper's satirical watercolour of <em><a href=/site/page.cfm?u=519&amp;c=1620>Pioneers landing at Port Adelaide</a></em> in 1839 mocks the primitive conditions which new settlers found when they arrived in the colony. Skipper is known for the tiny detailed sketches in the margins of diaries and published books in his possession. Many of these are satirical in nature and play upon a small section of text on the page which Skipper has underlined. The State Library of South Australia holds several examples of his work in this style, including <em><a href=http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au/record=b1367340>Psellus' dialogue on the operation of daemons</a></em> and <em><a href=http://www.catalog.slsa.sa.gov.au/record=b1337918>South Australian almanack and general directory for 1841</a></em>. These items can be requested and viewed in the State Library's Somerville Reading Room.</p> <p>Skipper retired in 1872 and lived on a small pension on his farm at Kent Town where he died intestate on 7 December 1883. He was survived by three sons and four daughters; his eldest son, Spencer John (1848-1903), was a journalist and satirist in Adelaide.</p> <p>The staff member who selected this item for the 'staff favourites' exhibition writes 'the appeal of Skipper's annotated almanacs is that he seems to have done the drawings to entertain himself rather than the public. Skipper draws with fine detail and I especially like that he has picked up words in the text of the published work and taken inspiration from them for the sketches. Often he shows quite an irreverent sense of humour in the sketches!'</p></div>",,-34.93,138.59,Book,Andrew Murray,Adelaide,"Murray, Andrew",,NULL

The latter overtook Randell near Swan Hill, and for some time the two paddle-steamers passed and repassed each other. Randell continued on to deliver stores at Moama, the <em>Lady Augusta</em> returning downstream to collect a load of wool bales. The media promoted this as a race, although there were no such intentions initially.</p> <p>Randell and Cadell's efforts successfully opened the river as a highway for paddle steamers. Supplies for distant river communities could now be transported hundreds of miles inland, including the carrying of supplies to the Victorian gold fields. Station owners could ship their woolclip downriver more conveniently and quickly than by using bullock drays. Cadell established his River Murray Navigation Company and for a number of years had contracts with both the South Australian and New South Wales governments to remove snags from the river, before finally abandoning the river trade for other interests. Randell however continued and prospered, building a considerable fleet of paddle steamers before handing his busines interests over to his son Murray in 1899.</p></div>",,-34.37,139.62,Book,,,,,NULL

The taxes collected at Goolwa on goods carried to New South Wales and Victorian customers were credited to those colonies, but it became apparent quickly that they were loosing revenue and by 1855 these colonies decided to collect their own taxes, and Albury and Wodonga became customs points for their respective colonies.</p></div>",,-34.78,138.44,Book,Govt Printer,Adelaide,South Australia.

Orphaned as a young boy, he eventually became a seaman and made several voyages before going to the West Indies to work on a sugar plantation. He later took on other work there before joining a group of privateers. Eventually he joined the crew of the <em>Cygnet</em> for a voyage in the Pacific Ocean. Arriving in the Philippines the crew including Dampier mutinied, abandoned the captain and some of the crew and sailed off. After cruising through the islands of Indonesia, the <em>Cygnet</em> arrived on the Australian coast, at a place now known as Dampier's Landing.</p> <p>After many more adventures Dampier returned to England and wrote an account of his travels. This proved very popular and his experience sailing in the Pacific led the Admiralty in 1699 to appoint him to the command of the <em>Roebuck</em> and exploration in the South Seas, in particular the land on which he had so briefly landed. Dampier discovered Shark Bay on the Western Australian coast and then cruised north along the coast for some distance, discovering Dampier Archipelago and Roebuck Bay but because of the lack of water abandoned the coast to head for Timor. From here he sailed north around New Guinea and discovered the islands of New Britain and New Ireland. The unseaworthy <em>Roebuck</em> on its return voyage to England, sank off the Ascension Islands, but Dampier and crew reached safety and finally England. Where he was court martialled for the loss of his ship and poor management of his crew after a complaint was lodged. But while a poor manager of men Dampier was a good observer of nature: his collection of botanical specimens is still held in Oxford. These include a specimen of <a href=http://www.anbg.gov.au/emblems/sa.emblem.html>Sturt Desert Pea</a>, first collected by Dampier on Rosemary Island in the Dampier Archipelago.</p> <p>In 1699 as part of his account of his voyages he published 'A discourse of the winds ...' his observations of the winds and currents of the world's oceans.

It had originally been prepared for Francis I King of France, but when Rotz failed to find a position in the French court he moved to England. His <em>Boke</em> contains a general world map and 11 other charts of regions of the world. It can therefore make some claim to being the first atlas, predating <a href=/site/page.cfm?u=70&amp;c=1454>Abraham Ortelius</a> by about 28 years.</p> <p>Java la Grande is the large land mass south of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, and could possibly represent some charting of the Australian coast by French or Portuguese navigators. It is part of the chart for the Far East and East Indies. Orientation of the map is with south at the top. It is considered that the map is derived in part from an earlier Portuguese chart and it contains a mixture of French and Portuguese names. One name 'Coste dangereuse' would later be construed by some scholars as a reference to the reefs along the east coast of Australia and evidence of Portuguese discoveries there.</p> <p>Java la Grande was considered either as a separate very large island or as part of a vast southern continent or Terra Australis incognita. The ancient Greeks had hypothesised that there should exist a large land mass to counter balance Europe and Asia. When Ptolemy of Alexandria published his <em>Geographia</em> circa 150AD he produced the hypothetical southern continent of Terra Australis nondum cognita, or the Unknown South Land. In Ptolemy's map of the world he joined the known east coast of Africa with East Asia, landlocking the Indian Ocean. By the early 16th century, Africa had been rounded by Portuguese explorers and India and the East Indies reached. The Indian Ocean could no longer be considered to be land-locked.

Some internees were crew members of enemy nationality who were taken from ships in Australian ports. In South Australia, a relatively high percentage of migrants were of German background, and so the 'enemy alien' concept had a significant effect.

The men with their huge flock travelled down the Murrumbidgee River and after crossing the Lachlan River travelled across country to pick up the River Murray about 20 miles east of the junction with the Darling. At the North West Bend (Morgan) they left the river travelling across country again to Anlaby where Dutton's sheep were left, before taking the remainder on down to Adelaide.</p> <p>Buchanan would later become the manager of Anlaby station for Dutton.</p></div>",,-34.37,139.62,Magazine,H.

Line 3 is of Lacepede Bay near Cape Bernouilli (now Cape Jaffa) in the south-east and Line 4 is of part of Fleurieu Peninsula. In line 5 (K) shows Ile Turenne which is actually Waterhouse Point on Thistle Island in Spencer Gulf; (L) Ile Lagrange is Boston Island. Lines 6 and 7 show portions of the west coast of the state, with (Q) Ile Cuvier being Olive's Island. In the era before photography the profiles of newly discovered coasts formed an important part of the descriptions of new found lands, enabling later travellers along these coasts to identify exactly where they were. For us today they give views of the coast before settlement and colonisation changed the appearance of the land.</p> Born in Le Havre in January 1778, Charles-Alexandre Lesueur was the son of a naval officer. He loved drawing, especially natural history, and wanted to travel to far off lands. He joined the Baudin expedition as a crew member, and like fellow artist Nicolas-Martin Petit was able to take over as an expedition artist when the official artists resigned. Lesueur became the natural history artist, and his images of Australia's exotic marine life are particularly striking. He was a friend of the expedition's chief scientist Francois P ©ron, and when P ©ron became ill after the expedition had returned to France, Lesueur nursed him until his death in 1810. In 1815 Lesueur went to the United States and travelled extensively there and in the West Indies before deciding to settle in Philadelphia. Lesueur stayed in the United States for 25 years, where he discovered a number of zoological species including tortoises and fishes. He taught painting, and was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society, and of the Academy of Natural Sciences. Lesueur returned to France in 1837, and in 1845 went back to Le Havre to oversee the building of the Natural History Museum. He became this museum's first Director. Lesueur died in 1846, having been awarded the Legion of Honour in the previous year.</div></div>",,-29.38,135.86,Book,De L&apos;Imprimerie Imperiale,Paris,"Freycinet, Louis de, 1779-1842",,NULL
