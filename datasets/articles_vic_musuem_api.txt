    "content": "<p><em><strong>'We live in a world of Somme mud. We sleep in it, work in it, fight in it, wade in it and many of us die in it.</strong>'</em> Private Edward Francis Lynch, 45 Battalion, 4th Division AIF, 1916. </p>\n<p>The Battle of the Somme (Somme Offensive) saw the allied forces of Australia, Britain and France push forward against the German Imperial Force in a series of battles that inched the Allies north over the summer and autumn of 1916. From July until November, a mere 10 kilometres of ground was gained at a cost never before seen in the history of warfare. </p>\n<p>For Australian soldiers who had recently been in the Middle East, the first sight of the green farmlands of France was a relief. As they moved closer to the front, however, the bitter reality of battle on the Western Front became clear. With the approach of colder weather life became even harder, and those who endured the Somme of 1916 remember near-freezing weather and plains of deep mud. Troops on either side battled to supply their front line with food, munitions and medical treatments &#8211; meanwhile the mud and trench warfare meant simple tasks of communication became deathly gambits. Some of the most dangerous roles on the front included message runners, ammunition and water suppliers, and stretcher bearers. Men moving along the tops of trenches or venturing into no-man&#8217;s land were vulnerable to mass shelling and machine-gun fire. </p>\n<p>Australia paid a terrible cost for its involvement at the Somme. After massive casualties north at Fromelles on 19-20 July (an unsuccessful attempt to draw German troops away from the Somme Offensive), fighting at Pozieres and Mouquet Farm from 23 July to 3 September cost the First, Second and Fourth Australian Divisions some 23,000 wounded and 6,800 killed. Losses by other nations were even higher. On the first day of the Somme Offensive, the British army suffered 57,470 casualties including 19, 240 deaths. German losses on that day were estimated at 4,000 casualties and 2,000 captured; in total Germany lost an estimated 650,000 men during the Offensive. </p>\n<p>These high loses were in part due to the rapid mechanisation of World War I weapons. At the beginning of World War I, Germany possessed 1,200 machine guns. By July 1916, and the Somme Offensive, 11,000 machine guns were trained at the Allied forces. Each side raced to create larger and heavier-class weapons, such as British tanks and 420mm heavy German guns. The power of these enormous weapons was almost useless as they could barely be dragged, by horse, men or rail, through the Somme mud. </p>\n<p>As the terrible costs of the Somme mounted, both sides made significant changes to their commanders, tactics and strategies. In many ways, the Battle marked a watershed in World War I.</p>\n<p>For tens of thousands of front-line soldiers, the Battle of the Somme was also a watershed. As the French landscape was destroyed, many soldiers poignantly captured what they saw in photographs. As a way to cope, and to communicate with loved ones back home, many Australians documented their experience through diaries, letters and souvenirs. The tone and detail of these changed as their war experience continued. </p>\n<p>Museum Victoria&#8217;s collection of Somme memorabilia is typified by personal items &#8211; especially those worn or carried through the war, or which document an individual war experience. While military censorship reigned strong and restricted what could be sent home during 1914-1918, these items allow a personal and moving insight into life in the Somme Offensive. For many, these battles would continue on, reaching the home front and civilian life in deep ways. </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>&#8216;Australians in War&#8217;, Australian War Memorial, London, website: <a href=\"http://www.awmlondon.gov.au/australians-in-wwi\">http://www.awmlondon.gov.au/australians-in-wwi</a> (accessed 20/01/2016) <br>&#8216;World War I 1914-1918&#8217;, Australian War Memorial, Canberra, website: <a href=\"https://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/\">https://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/</a> (accessed 20/01/2016)<br>Beaumont, J.

    "content": "<p><strong>Acknowledging the Contributions of Women to the Gatherings<br></strong>The Women on Farms Gathering Memorial Plaque is prominently displayed at each gathering to acknowledge the special role of key women in past gatherings.</p>\n<p>It was initiated by Maree Ryan, a member of the organising commitee for the Ouyen Gathering in 1998 and presented with the names of Eileen Patricia (Pat) Hall from Mittyack, and Kathleen (Kath) Paynter from Chillingolah, who had both attended every gathering since its inception in 1990. Over the years other women have been acknowledged on the plaque including Rhonda Weatherhead and Muriel Dick.</p>\n<p><strong>Mallee Root - a Symbol of an Enduring Spirit<br></strong>The memorial plaque is made from a Mallee root, cut and polished by John Hughes, a local craftsman from Manangatang.</p>\n<p>The north west corner of Victoria was the last region of Victoria to be settled. This was largely because of the challenges of this dry, semi-arid area and the abundance of mallee scrub. The mallee eucalypt has many stems that rise up from a large bulbous woody root (lignotuber); they are tough trees and can withstand the ravages of droughts, fires, and land clearing. Farming in the mallee demands the same tenacity and toughness that characterise the mallee scrub.</p>\n<p>The mallee root was also selected as one of the icons for the Swan Hill Gathering to symbolise the enduring spirit, energy, beauty and resilience of rural women.  The single furrow plough on the top of the plaque directly references the Mallee farming community.</p>\n<p><strong>Pat Hall<br></strong>The plaque was created following the tragic death of Pat Hall in January 1997. While on holiday at Rosebud, she was injured in a car accident and died from her injuries two days later. Pat was remembered as 'A woman of many dimensions ... kind, generous and compassionate - a person who truly celebrated life' (Women on Farms Gathering, 1998b, p.3). Jenny Simpson recalled at the Ouyen Gathering how 'Those of us who attended the first Women on Farms Gathering in Warragul some 9 years ago will all remember how Pat and her good friend Marion shared their stories of life on a Mallee farm with the Gathering. Both their stories brought with them laughter and tears. It was the next day that Pat and Marion decided with the few other women from the Mallee that it would be fun to hold the next Gathering' (Women on Farms Gathering, 1998a, p.9). And so began the annual tradition of gatherings of rural women across Victoria.</p>\n<p>Pat was also the inspiration and energy behind the organisation of the 1998 Ouyen Gathering and its theme <em>United We Meet United We Stand</em>. The Ouyen Gathering and the Ecumenical Service were dedicated to the memory of Pat Hall. </p>\n<p><strong>Kath Paynter<br></strong>Kath was born in Ballarat, 1922. Her parents were pioneers of the Chillingollah district where she lived all her life, except for secondary schooling and teaching. She left teaching and married a local farmer in 1948 and raised six children. In addition to farming Kath taught at the Lady Byrnes Centre for Intellectually Handicapped people for seven years. </p>\n<p>Kath was a member of the 1995 Swan Hill Gathering organising committee and attended all of the gatherings. She loved the concept of the gatherings as a way to renew friendships, share experiences and swap ideas and information.</p>\n<p><strong>Dedication to Pat Hall and Kath Paynter, by Yvonne Jennings at the 1998 Ouyen Gathering<u><br></u></strong><em>The passing of our dear Pat Hall from Mittyack and Kath Paynter from Chillingollah saddened us all. I recently read a book called 'For She is the Tree of Life: Grandmothers through the eyes of women writers', edited by Valerie Kack-Brice, and it brought home to me the real value of our elder members - their wisdom, stability, continuity and practical commonsense.</em></p>\n<p><em>In this book the stories of many different grandmothers are told and there is something to be learned from each - although like Pat and Kath, each of these women would probably be amazed to hear that.</em></p><em>The following quote is particularly apt I feel:</em> \n<p></p><em>'The Cut of Her Cloth':<br>While many of our Grandmothers led simple lives, some lived simply in the middle of extraordinary circumstances, demonstrating great courage, fortitude and commitment. Undaunted by specific events, they were tenacious in their survival, hope, and connection to family. For some grand-daughters, the example of how their grandmothers lived offered valuable lessons and gave gifts, sometimes even resulting in a determination to live differently. For others, a particular quality of being, such as eccentricity, stoicism, or dignity, is most notable.</em> \n<p></p>\n<p><em>I believe Pat and Kath are here with us and the last thing they would want is to have us overcome by their not having a visible presence. As 'grandmothers' of the gathering who have passed on and become part of that spirit of the Gathering that is generated each year when we get together I know that they would not want us to dwell on and be weakened by their passing, but instead be strengthened and healed by being together.</em></p>\n<p><em>As a mark of respect and in their memory a board with their names has been made and people from other areas are welcome to add women from their area if they wish. It will be passed on to each Gathering with the <a href=\"http://museumvictoria.com.au/collections/items/274193/banner-women-on-farms-gathering-victoria-1990-2004\">banners</a>. </em>(Women on Farms Gathering, 1998a, p.7)</p>\n<p><strong>Dedication to Rhonda Weatherhead, by Marie Harding at the 1999 Warragul Gathering:<u> <br></u></strong><em>6th June 1937 - 7th August 1998</em></p>\n<p><em>Rhonda died last year on the 7th August, she was born in Yarram on 6th June 1937, 61 was far too young to die. Rhonda was a true Gippslander, she went to school in Gormandale and Traralgon. At 20 she fell in love and married a young farmer from Tynong North, Graham Weatherhead. They had four children - Sally, Ian, Jan and Allan, very sadly Ian died of SIDS.</em></p>\n<p><em>On the farm Rhonda shared the workload with Graham. Her country upbringing, love of animals and boundless energy made her a good farmer. Rhonda was an inaugural member of our Women on Farms organisation and co-founder of the Tynong North Community Group. She was also an active member of the Uniting Church. Rhonda was a fun lady and a bit of a dare devil. She had an infectious laugh, and would have a go at anything. When Rhonda and Graham retired 4 years ago they expected to have a long life of fun in the sun in the northern winters in Mackay, Queensland. But sadly that wasn't to be. Rhonda was the one who introduced me and many others in this room to the Women on Farms and I like many here tonight miss this lady greatly.</em> (Women on Farms Gathering, 1999, p.36)</p>\n<p><strong>Dedication to Muriel Dick, by Shirley Martin at the 2001 North East Women on Farms Gathering, Beechworth:<br></strong><em>Vale Muriel Dick</em></p>\n<p><em>This year we remember Muriel Dick, a true pioneer and co-founder of the original Gathering. In marking Muriel's death from breast cancer, we acknowledge her friendship, sense of humour and enormous contribution to the 'movement'. Muriel's name will be added to the women on Farms Gatherings Memorial. Shirley Martin spoke about Muriel's life and legacy:</em></p>\n<p><em>When I first met Muriel back in 1988 at an informal meeting of setting up the Skills Courses for Women on Farms I thought to myself my goodness what have I met? This woman, farming over 200 acres, running 100 breeders on her own, very independent, strong willed, strong in her views on farming, especially looking after the environment.</em></p>\n<p><em>When Muriel was talking to farming women who lacked self confidence in themselves, she would encourage them to have a go. Muriel herself was once in the supporting role, saying 'yes my dear' till the death of her late husband. Then the shock hit her; sell up the farm, live in town or take on the challenge of managing the farm herself? And yes, Muriel took that challenge on and all the women who knew her could understand why.</em></p>\n<p><em>For many Gippsland farming women Muriel was a real light in their life, always making sure that any new women who came to the Women on Farms Discussion Group would not be alone and feel uncomfortable. Muriel enjoyed these discussion group days and the Gatherings where she was able to chat with other farming women. Often she would give a cheeky grin, cover her lips and say 'Oh, was that me? I will be quiet.' But five minutes later away she would go again. You could always guarantee that the farm and her two beloved dogs, sex and men would come into the conversation. There are three sayings that Muriel used, they were 'Say it as it really is'; 'Yes I do know what you are saying and where you are coming from' and 'Always love and nurture yourself'.</em></p>\n<p><em>The women who have come to know Muriel as a friend are very grateful for the friendship and knowledge that she has given to them over the years. Many thanks must go to Muriel because of the informal chat that led to the very first Gathering at Warragul in 1990 and we are all here this weekend in Beechworth to enjoy this wonderful Gathering. Her smiling face will be sadly missed.</em> (Women on Farms Gathering, 2001, pp. 20-21) </p>\n<p><strong>References<br></strong>Women on Farms Gathering 1995a, <em>The 6th Annual Women on Farms Gathering Proceedings</em>, Swan Hill Women on Farms Gathering, Swan Hill, Victoria, p. 5<br>Women on Farms Gathering 1995b, <em>The 6th Annual Women on Farms Gathering, April 28th, 29th &amp; 30th</em>, Swan Hill Women on Farms Gathering, Swan Hill, Victoria, p.14<br>Women on Farms Gathering 1998a, <em>9th Annual Women on Farms Gathering Proceedings Handbook, Friday 27th to Sunday 29th March</em>, Ouyen Women on Farms Gathering, Ouyen, Victoria, pp.7, 9<br>Women on Farms Gathering 1998b, <em>Weekend Handbook, 27-29 March 1998, Ouyen, North West Victoria</em>, Ouyen Women on Farms Gathering, Ouyen, Victoria, p.3<br>Women on Farms Gathering 1999, <em>Tenth Annual Women on Farms Gathering Proceedings, 30th April to 2nd May</em>, Warragul Women on Farms Gathering, Warragul, Victoria, p.36<br>Women on Farms Gathering 2001, <em>12th Annual Victorian Women on Farms Gathering Proceedings, 20th, 21st and 22nd of April, Beechworth, North East Victoria</em>, North East Women on Farms Gathering, Beechworth, Victoria, pp.20-21<br></p>",

YPIRANGA / 8.30p.m. Thursday / 22nd Mary 1919 / My dearest Freda / We have spent a / most interesting day in Las / Palmas &#8211; the boat pulled in / about 5am this morning / and left about 2pm &#8211; we / do not see land again for / another fortnight. I hope the / mail we sent ashore turns up / alright. Every blessed native of / the island appeared to be / notified of our arrival as the / bum boats with all the rubbish . in the world were at the entrance / of the harbour waiting for us / &amp; as soon as we anchored we were / besieged by the blighters / </p>\n<p>[SECOND PAGE] &amp; the bargaining began at once. / Cigars bearing the name of a / very good brand &#8220;Henry Clay&#8221; / were offered for &#163;2.10 a hundred / the [illeg.] were beaten down / to infinitely small prices / some bought them at the / start for 25/- &amp; then the lowest / the niggers would take was / 15/- in exceptional cases boxes / were bought for 10/- of course / I did not for one moment believe / they were genuine &amp; many / others were of the same opinion / as the price for the same cigar / in London is not about &#163;5. / the blessed things were an&nbsp; / awful swindle as a few of us / were talking to an Englishman / who lives in the town &amp; who / came aboard he said the Cabel / and bores were made by Germany / </p>\n<p>[THIRD PAGE] and the cigars manufactured by / filthy natives in the port &amp; / could be bought ashore for 8/-, / I very nearly bought a box / for that amount but the old / nig would not see it does / not matter at what price they / sell, they make a nice little / profit. Any brand of cigars / it is immaterial how bad they / are, are worth 10/- a hundred / each &#8211; the cheapest cigar one&nbsp; / can buy in Australia is about / 3d or 2d. The fruit was horribly / disappointing &amp; very expensive / bananas 1d each oranges 1d each / that was all they had. / </p>\n<p>[FOURTH PAGE] I was trying to pick up a&nbsp; / little ivory elephant merely as / a souvenir of the place by the / beggars wanted 4/- for it &amp; an / officer next to me had only a / few minutes before bought the / same thing for 2/-. Bedspreads / were in great demand and they / were offered at &#163;5.10 &amp; upwards / heaps were eventually bought / for &#163;1 of the sisters on board / say they were very good / bargain at that price. The / nig. Would display one / and some on would buy it after / bartering for 1/2 an hour &amp; / if the purchaser was not very / careful the one he asked for / would be replaced by another / worth a few shillings. All the / boats have little back ? attached / </p>\n<p>[FIFTH PAGE] &amp; a chord attached to it in which / you put the money &amp; then up come / the goods. Silk pyjamas were / sold for about 15/- the price / asked was &#163;2.10 but the silk / is awfully trashy&nbsp; stuff and / I doubt if it will stand being / washed &#8211; I am sure a person / could not do a quick bend / in them. We have a boat load / of canaries on board &#8211; I think / nearly every digger on the / ship has one &amp; they can be / bought much cheaper in / Australia. 5/- was about the / lowest price for them. After the / men had bought the bird they / began to wonder how they were / </p>\n<p>[SIXTH PAGE] going to sell them &amp; of course there / the dago had them &#8211; for 1/- / they got enough canary seed to / fill a hollow tooth. There were / heaps of puppies that could just / crawl offered at about 10 at 1/-, / none were bought chiefly because / they are not allowed on board. / No one was allowed off the boat. / Bargaining is the greatest / fun in the world &#8211; as you can / see there are no fixed prices / &amp; every body gets as much as / possible for his rubbish one / nigger offered me a cigarette / case for &#163;5.10 &amp; another the/ same thing for 35/- I bargained / for about 1/2 and hour through a / port hold over the blessed thing / &amp; offered 10/- - the nig I think / was cursing inwardly he / </p>\n<p>[SEVENTH PAGE] swung his arms about &amp; danced / like a heathen &#8211; but he would / not let that case go &#8211; he was at / one time just about to say &#8220; put / the money in the basket&#8221; when his / co-conspirator thief stopped / him. I might have got it if I / had given another a few shillings. / It is really the funniest thing / going and highly amusing / in every way. / Of course we also had boys / diving for money. I have / never seen such a cut throat / looking lot before [crossed out] in / colour they ranges from jet / black to white. / 10p.m. 23rd Several casualties to / </p>\n<p>[EIGHTH PAGE] this evening. Four canaries / were committed to a watery / grave this morning and I / imagine the remainder will be / there before we reach Australia. / Could not do any boxing this / morning as the deck was too / slippery having been / washed with caustic soda &#8211; so / had to content myself with a / skifs? This afternoon I had / chipped a bit off an old / stopping, trying to crack / nuts. I always expected to&nbsp; / do something like that &#8211; in / future I will be more careful. / This evening I played bridge / &amp; came out winning the / huge sum of 1/6d &#8211; the weather / has been much cooler today / &amp; by all the rules of the game it / should be getting hotter. / </p>\n<p>[NINTH PAGE] 10.20p.m. 14/5/19&nbsp; A most unexciting day / except that I managed to pick up / a very interesting book that kept / me occupied the whole day. / This afternoon after [crossed out] / lunch 6 of us congregated in . our cabin &amp; told of our / various experiences during / the last 4 years. We were all / sprawled out on the floor as it / is the coolest position. Have just / been doing a little bit of/ doctoring turning a young / fellow&#8217;s eye lid inside out and / painting it with some / rubbish &#8211; every time I got the / blessed thing ready for work the / blighter would wince and / </p>\n<p>[TENTH PAGE] we had to commence again. / I got quite a lot of fun out of it / although the patient suffered /somewhat. / It has been remarkably / cool today and tonight for / the first time for years we saw / the Southern Cross. / We learned tonight that as / far as Lad Palmas the old boat / was going rottenly. One / engine broke down. The steering / gear went wrong &amp; she was / leaking badly &amp; the maximum / speed was about 11 knots / everything if going well now / &amp; we average about 12 1/2 knots / &amp; for 2 hours last night we did / 17 &#8211; I wish we could do 117 - / although it is pleasant enough / on board. / </p>\n<p>[ELEVENTH PAGE] 10p.m 25/5/19 &#8211; Today has been the / hottest since we left &#8211; but it is / great &#8211; I picture you having / such a day in [illeg.] and / playing tennis while we were / playing quoits.

He is a reformist / to a large extent the diggers / flock to hear him talk &amp; he / has got them worrying over / religious questions to an / unexpected degree. / </p>\n<p>[TWELFTH PAGE] This afternoon &#8211; Dawson &amp; I / took a rug &amp; pillow &amp; lay on / the boat deck in the breeze &amp; / read ourselves to sleep &#8211; even / the band playing did not / wake me up. Am going to / sleep in a bathing costume / tonight as the ordinary / sleeping suit is too warm / &amp; we have a door &amp; 2 port holes wide open / &amp; an electric fan going the / whole night.

Bon soir. / </p>\n<p>[SIXTEENTH PAGE] 10. 15p.m. 27/5/19 The concert party gave / another show tonight but I / thought it wiser to have a / stretch on the boat deck as / it is frightfully hot.

Here is a little story. / One man was remonstrating / with another regarding his / manners in a restaurant as he / </p>\n<p>[SEVENTEENTH PAGE] had tried to eat his soup / with a fork &amp; when asked the / reason why said &#8220;Well a fellow / must have something&nbsp; to / spear them peas with.&#8221; / One man (a) was asking another / man (B) what animals he liked / best at the Zoo &amp; &#8216;B&#8217; said the / Dangeroos A said &#8220;You mean / Kangeroos B said no Dangaroos / they looked like lions.

Managed to / lose a whole shilling. We / crossed the line about 7pm - / Yesterday was quite cool / where as it should have been / extremely hot &#8211; it should / get cooler and cooler as we / get south &#8211; I prefer the heat / Did nothing exciting at all yesterday &#8211; except be / inoculated about 2pm - / it has not at all affect [sic] me / as this morning I was up / on deck doing a little / strenuous exercise.

    "content": "<p>Trooper George Simpson Millar was born in 1892 to Thomas Glass Millar and Annie Noble Simpson. He went to Geelong Grammar, but moved to Brisbane Grammar after his family relocated to Brisbane. During his time at these schools he served as a cadet. He and his sister were frequently mentioned in the Brisbane Society columns, holding parties at their home 'Nowranie'. There is a photo in the collection of Nancie in a swimsuit (MM 050491) and there is a newspaper clipping with her wedding notice.</p>\n<p>In October 1914, when Millar was 23 years old, he enlisted with the Australian Imperial Forces and was assigned to the 5th Light Horse Regiment, C Squadron. Millar left Australia for Egypt in December 1914 on the HMAT Persic. </p>\n<p>The Regiment arrived in Egypt in January 1915 and moved to el-Ma'adi (Meadi) Camp on 2 February 1915. The 5th Light Horse Regiment was billeted at the el-Ma'adi (Meadi) camp until 14 May 1915, when the regiment left for Gallipoli. At Gallipoli George Simpson Millar served as a stretcher-bearer and was described by his fellow soldier Harry Hammond (photographed in MM 050451) as &quot;A chap called George Miller [sic], who was always on the make, telling other people what to do without knowing himself&quot; (memoirs of Harry Hammond). He remained in Gallipoli until August, when he suffered scalded hands and was shipped out on the SS Caledonia to England.</p>\n<p>In November 1915 Trooper Millar was granted a provisional discharge to take up a commission as a Second Lieutenant with the Royal Field Artillery, Special Reserve in the British Army. Millar served with the Royal Field Artillery for 2 1/2 years before re-enlisting as a Lieutenant with the Australian Imperial Force in January 1918. </p>\n<p>Following his re-enlistment in the AIF Millar was assigned to the 5th Divisional Artillery which served in France, before suffering from asthma and being 'invalided out' to England in August 1918. He returned to Australia in December 1918 on board the Saxon and was discharged in 1919.</p>\n<p>In recognition of his services George Millar received the 1914-15 Star and the British War Medal. George Simpson Millar died in Grafton, NSW in 1973.</p>\n<p>Trooper Millar appears in images MM 050527; MM 050528; MM 050530; MM 050533; MM 050541; MM 050554; MM 050555, MM 107499, MM 05035, MM 050437, MM 050427, MM 050434, MM 050463 and MM 050487.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p>The AIF Project<br>Ancestry.com<br>Australian War Memorial<br>The National Archives of Australia<br>NSW Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages<br>Trove <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/19546555\">http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/19546555</a> <a href=\"http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/23594832\">http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/23594832</a> <br>Harry Hammond's memoirs Australian War Memorial: PR01775<br></p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Jo Takasuka</strong> </p>\n<p>Jo Takasuka was born on 13 February 1865 in Matsuyama, Ehime Prefecture, Japan. Educated in Japan and America, he was elected as a member of the House of the Representatives in Japan in 1898, and he served as a Member of Parliament for five years. </p>\n<p>In 1905 with his wife, Ichiko, and two small children, Sho and Aiko, he migrated to Australia, arriving in Melbourne on the ship &#8220;S.S. Empire&#8221; on 15 March. Soon after his arrival, he set up a trading company called &#8220;Takasuka, Dight and Company&#8221; at 136 Queen Street. He also taught Japanese at Stotts&#8217; and Hoare Business College, being the first Japanese to teach Japanese in a classroom situation in Australia. Due to the White Australia policy the Takasuka family were only given visas for a year. However, Jo managed to extend their visas for another year with Japanese consular assistance. </p>\n<p>With the extension to his visa, Jo Takasuka decided to grow rice, which Australia had to import from overseas at that time. With the help of Commonwealth analyst WP Wilkinson, he met the Premier and Minister for Crown Lands, Thomas Bent, and persuaded them to lease him crown land near the Murray River to undertake a rice growing experiment. The area was famous for flooding and Jo thought that it was an ideal area for rice farming as nothing else could be grown in that area. </p>\n<p><strong>Rice Growing Trials</strong> </p>\n<p>Jo battled against drought, floods, locusts, banks and changing government policies in his attempts to grow rice in Australia. His first rice crop in 1906, sewn on 35 acres of land in Nyah with seeds sent to him by his father, was eaten by sheep. In 1907 he planted 65 acres in a different location but only harvested three bags of rice. In 1909 his crop was destroyed by flooding which was again an issue the following year, though he was able to harvest enough rice to use as seeds in 1911. In 1913 Jo had his most successful year to date harvesting one ton of rice per acre, this success continued in 1914 with a harvest of over one ton per acre. From 1915 Jo began a long running battle with the government relating to assistance with his rice growing trials and security of tenure over his land. Jo battled more floods in 1920 and 1921 which put him under severe financial strain. Despite a successful harvest in 1922, Jo faced continued opposition from the government who had been planning to use his land to settle newly arrived migrants since 1911. In 1926 commercial production of rice started around Murrumbidgee area (NSW), using Takasuka rice grain, however it was unsuccessful. By 1927 an American variety of rice, Caloro, had become the dominant variety of rice in Australia. Jo abandoned rice growing due to financial difficulty, and he turned his attention to vine growing. By 1928, the government concluded that Takasuka rice was unviable, and Takasuka rice growing was completely abandoned. </p>\n<p>Jo returned to his home town, Matuyama, Japan in 1939 leaving his family behind, and passed away on February 15, 1940. His son Sho Takasuka became a successful tomato grower, and was Huntly Shire President from 1964 to 1970. </p>\n<p><strong>Legacy </strong></p>\n<p>Despite the hardships and continual setbacks he faced Jo Takasuka is undoubtedly the pioneer of rice growing in Australia. The road leading to the levee bank he constructed in Nyah Forest was named Takasuka Road, and a monument was built near the levee bank. The Takasuka family&#8217;s possessions are displayed at The Pioneer Settlement Museum in Swan Hill, and samples of the first rice ever grown in Australia by Jo Takasuka are in the collection of Museum Victoria. </p>\n<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>\n<p>For more information about Takasuka Rice and Jo Takasuka, refer to the essay: &#8216;Takasuka Rice' which can be accessed under the Associated Downloads section and is available in both English and Japanese.</p>",

It mainly involved replacing rotten or broken timber fence rails and posts; repair of fittings on gates and rails; re-laying bluestone pitchers; rubbish and manure removal; and cleaning and maintenance of the administration buildings. </p>\n<p>The yard rails were made of hardwood, some of the older posts were jarrah but most were red gum. Sometimes damage to the yard would be caused by animals pushing against fences or becoming stuck between fence rails. Emergency maintenance and repairs had to be made during the sales, with the work being done quickly around the stock. Council Clerks were responsible for record keeping of livestock moving in and out of the Saleyards, and a Council employee worked at the 'Back Gate' as a stock counter, collecting stock passes and tallying yard dues. Prior to its closure, the Melbourne City Council had over 38 employees and 5 staff officers working full time at Newmarket.</p>\n<p><strong>References:<br></strong>Wilson, G. 1982, <em>The Age</em>, 6 August.<br><br></p>",

As the oldest son of landed gentry, he was destined to become a clergyman, and in 1814 published as a member of Oxford University; but he confounded his family by eloping to Scotland with the pregnant Elizabeth Raby Brooks. They married in 1815. </p>\n<p>In 1816, after the disgrace of the wedding, George was offered a post well beyond Britain: Rector of St Ann's, Jamaica. George and Elizabeth had six daughters and two sons, but the marriage became deeply unhappy, and Elizabeth eventually left him in 1834 with several children to care for.</p>\n<p>In 1828 George wrote <em>The Annals of Jamaica</em>, outlining Jamaica's history and expressing his staunch support of the slave trade. </p>\n<p>Tragedy struck on New Year's Day in 1837: all four surviving daughters were drowned in a boating accident in St Ann's Bay, Jamaica. Son&nbsp;William Somerset survived. Deeply distressed, George moved to Canada with William, and built a wooden tower house on Lake Rice, near Peterborough. Father and son returned to England in 1843 due to William's health problems. George became a rector&nbsp;in Gloucestershire; he is mentioned in clergy lists of 1859 to 1863 (the year he died). </p>\n<p>In 1846, having learned the basics of photography from Henry Fox Talbot, George set out on a seven-year photographic odyssey, including Italy and Greece. He had a selection of his works published on his return, and became Vicar of Beachley and private secretary to the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol. </p>\n<p>He died in 1863, and was buried with his wife in Beachley, beneath a rock inscribed in memory of their daughters. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>References:<br></strong>Museum Victoria SMV File No.81/62<br>George Hannavy (ed), Encyclopaedia of&nbsp;Nineteenth Century Photography</p>",

    "content": "<p>Moves for the colony of Victoria to become self reliant in terms of arms and ammunition production had first arisen around the middle of the nineteenth century when various assumed threats - namely the Russians, and later French - were at their peak. The withdrawal of the last British Imperial troops from Australia in 1870 only exaggerated a feeling of insecurity in terms of defence that had been building throughout the decade preceding their departure, a decade which saw the rapid rise of the Colony's volunteer forces. </p>\n<p>By the mid 1880s the topic of the 'Manufacture of Ammunition, Powder, &amp; c., in the Colonies' was appearing regularly in the local newspapers and was making advances at a political level. Prompted by the frequent media reports on the subject, the Victorian government began to receive offers for the establishing of factories based on the English models. Alexander Davidson, whose father had previously worked for ten years in a senior role with the British Government Shell Factory at Woolwich wrote that his father was 'prepared to come and superintend the fitting up of a factory for the manufacture of small-arms, ammunition, gun-powder, gun-cotton, torpedoes, and all other warlike material, and also the manufacture of it'. </p>\n<p>Britain's inability to adequately support colonial defence was looked on by some within the Colony with contempt: 'Under the present aspect of affairs it is not likely to be very long before the Imperial Government, in preparation for one of its numerous little wars, or to be in readiness for what may occur in Europe, may be drawing so heavily upon the powers of production in England, that the colonial orders will be put aside temporarily'. However, if Victoria could establish its own source of production locally, the Secretary of Defence wrote in December 1886, 'The [other Australian] colonies will then be only too glad to replenish their supplies from the nearest source available'. South Australia confirmed 'that this Government will be willing to obtain its gunpowder supplies at a fair rate from any Victorian factory'.</p>\n<p>By late 1886 the Government had determined its position. 'It is not the intention of the Government to establish a Government factory, but rather to trust to private enterprise, and it is expected that before long this manufacture will be undertaken by a private company'. Financial incentives were floated to encourage private contracts, with the Government offering a bonus of two thousand five hundred pounds 'to the first factory of the kind established in the colony', the promise of a free grant of land, and - providing quality matched that currently obtainable from England - figures of between two and three million solid-drawn rifle cartridges would be required by the Department of Defence. 'All Government supplies would be procured from the factory', the Secretary of Defence assured one applicant. </p>\n<p>Realisation of the project came in 1888 when Captain Whitney established the Colonial Ammunition Factory in Footscray. </p>\n<p>Subsequent additions were made across the inner western suburbs in 1908 with the opening of the Commonwealth Explosives factory at Maribyrnong and the Commonwealth Ordnance factory following the First World War. At its peak during the early 1940s more than 8000 workers were employed in the manufacture of ammunition and related explosives, providing thousands of jobs for western suburb workers for more than a century. </p>\n<p>The Colonial Ammunition Factory site was finally redeveloped, being replaced by the Edgewater housing estate in 2001. </p>\n<p><strong>References: <br></strong>'Arsenal and Small-Arms Factory: A copy of all expert's reports, letters, and other papers in connection with the establishment of an arsenal and small-arms factory in Australia', <em>Victorian Parliamentary Papers</em>, 1888, vol. 1, C.18.<br>Thomas, Benjamin (2002). <em>Up in Arms: A History of the State Arms Collection, 1856-1900,</em> unpublished BA Hons thesis, School of Fine Arts, Classical Studies and Archaeology, University of Melbourne.<br></p>",

By the end of the war the company was making boys shirts and then moved into mens shirts. </p>\n<p>In 1951 a shirt was produced from 30 denier Nylon and marketed under the name Glo-Weave. The 'Glo' representing the lustre of the fabric; 'weave' because, although the fabric was warpknitted, it looked woven. The shirt became so popular that in 1954 the company became Gloweave Proprietary Limited.</p>\n<p>Innovative advertising campaigns in print and in the new world of television commenced. In the late 1950's Gloweave was a major advertising sponsor of In Melbourne Tonight, Channel 9's groundbreaking show hosted by Graham Kennedy and Bert Newton. Kennedy proved a very popular advertiser. He helped make Gloweave a household name and popularised the &quot;Love me in my Gloweave&quot; slogan. </p>\n<p>Gloweave continued manufacturing shirts at their Brunswick Street factory in Fitzroy until the 1990s, when falling import tariffs made local manufacturing unprofitable. Today Gloweave Consolidated Pty Ltd continues selling shirts in Australia, but now they are manufactured offshore in Asia.</p>\n<p>References:<br>Gloweave website <a href=\"http://www.gloweave.com/about.asp\">http://www.gloweave.com/about.asp</a>&nbsp;viewed 16/06/2011<br></p>",

    "content": "<h3>Semiconductor Diodes in CSIRAC</h3>\n<p>The CSIR Mk1/CSIRAC used metal-oxide rectifiers in its power supply and some point contact diodes in its signal circuits. However, vacuum tubes or thermionic valves were used for most of the circuits. The transistor was invented in mid 1948 whilst the CSIR Mk1 was under construction and no transistors were used in the computer as originally built and as displayed at Museum Victoria. Later in the working life of CSIRAC (in 1960?), circuitry was designed and built by Jurij Semkiw to extend the capacity of the magnetic disk store. Low power transistors and simple printed circuit boards were used in the circuits developed to read data from the electro-magnetic read heads. However, due to the high cost of higher power transistors, vacuum tubes were still used for the write circuitry which recorded the magnetic signals onto the disk. This transistor circuitry has survived intact. However, it is not installed in the computer as displayed at Museum Victoria (2006), since the policy is to exhibit the computer as it was in 1956 when it was re-commissioned in Melbourne rather than as it was at the end of its working life.</p>\n<h3>Early Semiconductor Diodes</h3>\n<p>Prior to the invention of the transistor, semiconductor devices used in electrical circuits were almost always &quot;two terminal&quot; devices or diodes which enabled current to flow more freely in one direction than the other (it could be argued that the coherer used in very early radio communication was more than a two terminal device, as it enabled a controlling &quot;input&quot; signal to influence a larger &quot;output&quot; signal). Examples were the &quot;crystal&quot; used in crystal sets in which a small wire or cat's whisker made contact with a piece of galena and formed a diode junction at the point of contact.. Much heavier currents could be handled by diodes made by layers of selenium or of copper and copper oxide. These were used to convert alternating current to direct current by limiting current flow to one direction. This process was referred to as &quot;rectification&quot; and the devices were called rectifiers Selenium and copper-oxide rectifiers were frequently used in high current applications such as battery chargers and welders. (Vacuum tube thermionic diodes were also used as rectifiers, for instance in the power supplies domestic radio sets.) By the late 1940s, when CSIRAC was designed and constructed, point contact semiconductor devices (rather like a fixed cat's whisker) based on germanium, were available and could be used for low current applications.</p>\n<h3>Thermionic Valves</h3>\n<p>The earliest form of vacuum tubes (invented by John Fleming in 1904) had two electrodes (the anode and the cathode) and were referred to as diodes. More accurately, they were &quot;thermionic diodes&quot;. Since electric current could flow in only one direction through them they were also referred to as &quot;valves&quot;. Later vacuum tubes, such as &quot;triodes&quot; and &quot;pentodes&quot; had additional electrodes. Signals on one electrode (a grid) could control current flow between a cathode and anode. This enabled amplification, as a small signal potential on the grid could influence a large current between the anode and cathode. However, the term &quot;valve&quot; was still applied to these devices.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The Melbourne Centennial International Exhibition opened on August 1, 1888; it received over two million visitors (MacDonald 2001, p. 42). Victorian and Australian technological, material, and industrial progress were all exhibited, however contemporaries favoured music and art as pastimes indicative of the highest stages of civilisation (MacDonald 2001, 42). The centrality of the orchestra to the Exhibition indicated to a world audience that Australia was capable of rising from its convict heritage to attain an artistic conviction equal to European cultural achievements (MacDonald 2001, p. 48). The Centennial Orchestra was especially convened for the Melbourne Centennial International Exhibition. It was described as 'the most complete instrumental organisation seen in this part of the world' at its premiere in 1888 (The Argus, 1888). </p>\n<p>The Centennial Orchestra was led by Mr Frederick H. Cowen, a British Conductor who had accepted the 'very lucrative engagement' as Musical Director for the Centennial Exhibition (Ehrlich 1995, p. 149). Cowen was paid &#163;5000 for the six month appointment (Colligan, p. 214). Cowen was contracted to bring about fifteen good instrumental musicians from England with him, to strengthen the orchestra and lead various sections (1890, p. 260). The Argus reports that the names of the musicians alone were indicative of 'the quality and function of the various instruments upon which they perform' (Argus, 1888). Tympani player Mr J. Munyard was engaged as a local musician (Argus, 1888). </p>\n<p>The Argus wrote of the percussion section: 'the drums deserve to be spoken of by themselves on account of the important position they hold in all great instrumental organisations. First stand the kettle drums, consisting of vellum heads stretched over closed metallic vessels&#8230;the big drum, the grosse-caisse, with its thunderous boom, has its own effective part to play: but it is the kettledrums, with their accurate intonations, which are prized by the musician when aiming at orchestral effect' (Argus, 1888). </p>\n<p><strong>References</strong> </p>\n<p>1890. <em>The Official Catalogue of the Centennial International Exhibition Melbourne 1888-1889</em>.

    "content": "<p>DESCRIPTION OF THE ALETHOSCOPE </p>\n<p>The Alethoscope is an optical instrument by means of which all kinds of photographs can be seen 'in riliveo' - presenting a splendid perspective - nearly as large as nature. </p>\n<p>This effect may be obtained by reflexion or by transparency and can be seen by daylight as well as the light of a lamp, or other artificial light. </p>\n<p>When used by daylight, the instrument should be placed upon a table or in front of a window. After the photograph has been introduced through the aperture G (Fig. N.I), the two reflectors E, F must be thrown open so as to cast powerful light upon the photograph, which is thus seen by the medium of reflection. To observe it by transparency, the two reflections must be closed and the door L thrown open to cause the light of day to pass through the photograph. </p>\n<p>When the Alethoscope is used by night, a lamp should be placed at the aperture of reflector F so as to allow the photograph to be seen by reflection. To obtain the effect of transpondency, the reflectors must be closed, the door L opened and the lamp placed in front of it. These effects can, however, only be obtained by using photographs prepared for the purpose. </p>\n<p>The spectator must look through the aperture A (Figure N.I) adapting the glasses to his sight by means of the two handles C.C. </p>\n<p>To prevent the glare of light troubling the eyes, while the photographs are being changed, it is advisable to introduce a new photograph before the old one has been removed, namely by placing it in the second slide of the aperture G. </p>\n<p>The Alethoscope is available for photographs of the smallest dimensions, which are magnified and placed 'in riliveo' like the larger ones. The frames or supports for those photographs, which are to be seen in the interior of the instrument (Fig. N.2) must be lifted up and when the photograph has been placed in its frame, the relative diaphragm (Fig. N.3) which opens and shuts on hinges must be adapted to it. </p>\n<p>M is an iron ring on which the instrument turns round on itself by means of the handles B.B. (describing a quarter of a circle from right to left) in cases where the photograph has for its base the narrowest side instead of the broadest. In this case, the aperture G through which the photographs are introduced will be found at the top of the instrument instead of being on the right hand side. </p>\n<p>D opening to take out the glasses to clean them. </p>\n<p>The Alethoscope of C. NAYA is warranted superior to all those that have been manufactured up to the present time, for it has been perfected to such a degree that straight lines can be obtained in without employing photographs mounted on concave frames. The concave system of mounting is injurious to the solidity of the photograph, augments the defect of Sphericity and prevents the photographs, from being properly seen by reflection. </p>\n<p>ALETHOSCOPE PERFECTIONNE <br>de C NAVA a Venise </p>\n<p>Mr Naya rendra l'argent des photographies et des alethoscopes achetes chez lui aux personnel qui ne les trouveraient pas superieurs a tout ce qui se fabrique en ce genre a Venise. </p>\n<p>Prix l'Alethoscope simple en noyer veine Fcs 150 - <br>&quot; du meme avec appareill pour voir aussi les stereoscopes &quot; 160 - <br>&quot; chaque photographie colori&#233;e par transparence &quot; 5 - </p>\n<p>N.B. On peut se procurer les meme alethoscopes, plus riches en bois sculpte et encruste a des prix proportionellement plus eleves</p>",

    "content": "<p>On 28 May 1888 the Executive Commissioners for the Melbourne Centennial International Exhibition advertised a competition for the design of a medal and certificate to be given to exhibition prize-winners. A payment of 100 guineas would be given to the winner in each category. The medal designs were to be modelled in relief, and the designs for the certificate to be drawn in Indian ink. The medal was to show the Queen's head in profile on the obverse, and a 'suitable design' on the reverse. Nineteen designs for the medal were received, and&nbsp;fifty two&nbsp;designs for the certificate. A sub-committee from the Fine Arts Committee was appointed to select the winners, and on 18 January Ernst A. Altmann, a Melbourne die-sinker and engraver, was selected as the winner of the medal design, and Mrs Mary Stoddard the winner of the certificate design. </p>\n<p>The Royal Mint was asked to strike the medal, but Deputy Master George Anderson reported that some of the relief was almost undercut, requiring unusual pressure, and was not feasible. This had happened to Altmann before, when his winning design for the 1880 exhibition medal was also rejected. Altmann was too unwell to re-work his design, so George Anderson was asked to both design and execute the medal. The dies were to be engraved by Stokes &amp; Martin. Anderson set to work, and produced a medal that featured Queen Victoria's head on the obverse, based on the Jubilee medal by Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm, except that the crown had been replaced by a 'more firmly seated one which is seen in the New Zealand war medal'. On the reverse he provided a wreath composed of the leaves and acorns of British oak and the leaves and acorns of the wattle. The oak and wattle were tied together 'by a true-lover's knot, 'symbolizing the unity and affection between the mother country and the colony'. The motto 'Artibus dignis, honor insignis' - meaning 'to the deserving arts, distinguished honour' - was placed within the wreath, encircling the Southern Cross. </p>\n<p>The medals were minted in gold, silver and bronze, in 1-1/2&quot;, 2&quot; and 3&quot; in diameter respectively. The first medal was presented to Governor Sir H. B. Loch on the day of his departure from Victoria, 15 November 1889, 10 months after the close of the Exhibition. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "content": "<p>Edith Cavell was born at Swardeston, Norfolk, where her father was Rector. She was an accomplished artist and she and her sister sold paintings and cards to raise money to build a Church Room. She took several posts as a Governess in England and in Brussels. In 1895, she returned to Swardeston to nurse her father through a brief illness and decided to take up nursing as a career in 1896, training at the London Hospital. She worked in many nursing homes in England and in Brussels and, on 10 October 1907 took charge of a pioneer training school for lay nurses on the outskirts of Brussels. </p>\n<p>When World War I broke out in 1914, she was at home with her mother but returned to Brussels immediately. When that city fell to the Germans, they commandeered the hospital for their own wounded. English nurses were sent home, but Edith and her assistant, Miss Wilkins stayed. An 'underground lifeline' was established and some 200 Allied soldiers were helped to escape. This organization lasted for almost a year. Eventually her part in it was discovered; she was interned and sentenced to death. A Lutheran chaplain obtained permission for the English Chaplain to visit her on the eve of her execution and to administer the Blessed Sacrament to her. In the early hours of 12 October 1915, the death sentence was carried out by a firing squad. </p>\n<p>During her last hours, she wrote, 'Standing as I do in view of God and eternity, I realise that patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.' After the War, her remains were escorted to Westminster Abbey for the first part of the Burial Service, on 15 May 1919. A special train then took the remains to Norwich where they were interred in the Cathedral precincts.</p>\n<p>Museum Victoria holds several items that commemorate the life and contribution of Edith Cavell, including badges, photographs and a commemorative card. </p>",

    "content": "<p>In 1970, as a first-year Engineering student at Melbourne University, I was keen to be able to try out some computer programming. I had been introduced to Fortran programming in my final year at school in 1969 by way of hand-punched cards, batch processed at Monash University (probably using the Ferranti Sirius).</p>\n<p>So there I was, a mere five years since the demise of CSIRAC, a name still whispered in awe, and although I was only interested in time-wasting schoolboy programming at the time, such as numerical integration, or plotting graphs on the line-printer using rows of &quot;*&quot;, the 'Powers That Be' in the Melbourne University Computer Department took pity on me and granted me access to the computer, a rare privilege for first-year students.</p>\n<p>The computer of the time was an IBM 7044. I remember steaming up the window of the Architecture building, peering in to see if my job had been run. At that time, programming was done on punched cards, submitted in a little cardboard box in one of many pigeon holes set up in the computer department. Staff would come out of the inner sanctum periodically and take a few of the cardboard boxes next in line into the magic machine. Later the box would be returned, cards hopefully still in order, and the precious line-printer output. Nine times out of ten the printout would say 'Error nnn - Job Cancelled' and it would be back to the drawing board.</p>\n<p>One day the box contained more than just the printout, it had a note for me to report to the boss of the Computer Department, one Ron Bowles (of CSIRAC fame). I particularly remember his name because, as only an engineering student could, I mispronounced his name when asking his secretary to see him. I was rapidly corrected that his name was not 'Bowels'. I approached the deity in awe and trepidation. 'What are you doing to my computer? Every time I run your program you crash my computer!' he barked. 'And by the way, what are you doing using my computer, you insignificant little first-year being?'. But he was actually very kind, and helped me work out where I was writing outside the bounds of an array.</p>\n<p>The IBM 7044 had very little memory. I needed to use magnetic tape for temporary storage of data while running a program (in much the same way CSIRAC users had the 'drum' memory). This must have been very slow, but there was no other way.</p>\n<p>Using punched cards was a very tedious process, although perhaps not as tedious as paper tape which the users of CSIRAC had to cope with. At least with punched cards you could insert and delete lines in your program quite easily, which is not possible with paper tape. The best thing to do was to arrive at the university early in the morning or else stand in a long queue waiting for access to one of the three or four card punch machines available for general use. These machines were already antique, probably 1940s vintage. Although computers no longer used valves, the card punches still did. Editing was non-existent. If you made a mistake you had to scrap the card and start a new one. The only aid was the ability to duplicate from one card to the next, but this usually caused more trouble than it was worth.</p>\n<p>A few years later I used a punched card reader in Telstra and found out what happens when you forget to put in the weighted card-catcher in the output tray. A very large number of cards are spat out into the air very rapidly, landing in an unsorted, dishevelled pile on the floor. You only do that once, and it's not so bad when they are your own cards.</p>\n<p>In 1972 a gleaming new Cyber 73 computer arrived at the university. This opened new horizons - faster processing, more memory, on-line disk storage. Computer terminals started to appear around the campus, which saw the end of punched cards. Programs could now be stored on the computer and 'edited' on-line. The word 'edited' does not have its modern connotations of WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). These were 'line' editors which allowed you to find, insert&nbsp;and delete lines, and perform string substitutions. You really had to use annotated print-outs and keep a very clear mental picture of what you had done. </p>\n<p>With the new computer came the chance to perform quite complex electronic circuit simulations using a program called SPICE. This travelled across the Pacific surprisingly quickly from Berkeley in the days before the Internet. Even the Cyber had memory limitations; I had to partition the program into overlays to be allowed to run it. Unbelievably, SPICE is still in use today by the latest generation of electronic engineers, but of course on PCs.</p>\n<p>In about 1974 the Electrical Engineering department acquired a Data General Nova mini computer. Although punched cards had gone from the mainframe world, paper tape still reigned king in the mini world. To start up the Nova it was necessary first to enter the bootloader program manually into memory using a bank of 16 binary switches on the front panel of the machine. About 10 instructions had to be entered each with a different 16 bit binary pattern. Because the computer was American, the switches had to be set up for a '0' and down for a '1'. This was both confusing and illogical. Even Americans drew binary waveforms with a '1' at the top and a '0' at the bottom. Having installed the bootloader, the machine could now read its operating program from a high speed paper tape reader. Finally the user's program would be read from paper tape. The Nova was used for real time data logging, plotting and also for simulation programs.</p>\n<p>In Telstra (and its predecessors) I immediately moved to 8-bit microprocessor development work, leaving behind higher level languages such as Fortran, and going back to assembly language, very similar to what the CSIRAC programmers used. This level of programming and hardware design brings the user face-to-face with the inner workings of the processor, and makes it much easier to understand CSIRAC now.</p>\n<p>Early work used a National Semiconductor Imp desktop computer as a development machine for SC/MP microprocessors. The Imp had the same paper tape problems as the Nova, but fortunately the bootloader was in ROM by this stage. We all blessed the day when floppy disks arrived (8 inch beasts) and the nasty, slow paper tapes were thrown out.</p>\n<p>Work in AUSTPAC showed a different side of computers. Each AUSTPAC packet-switched data exchange had a capacity of about 500 4.8kbps customer lines, and contained about 100 4Mhz Z80 microprocessors working cooperatively. Network management was performed on DEC VAX and Honeywell DPS6 minicomputers, but eventually moved to the ubiquitous Unix boxes that Alan Bell refers to in his 1995 paper [1]. (AUSTPAC = AUSTralia PACket switching. For some reason it was always spelt in all capitals. It was a Telstra service supplying X.25 data packet switching to business (eg it supplied the Safeway backbone network for a while). It has now been superseded by the Internet or other private IP networks).</p>\n<p>And so, looking now at CSIRAC, 50 years later, through more experienced, but still inquisitive eyes, it is interesting to see how much has changed and how much has not. Fundamentally, modern computer architecture has not changed much since CSIRAC. The main differentiating feature of CSIRAC is the 'one-bit-wide' bit-serial architecture that it uses. What a brain-wave to bring together the serial nature of the memory with a serial processor to make a simple, cheap computer! The only expense was speed.</p>\n<p>One of the chief problems that slowed the development of computers including CSIRAC and SILLIAC right up to about 1980 was the high cost and small capacity of computer memory. More than anything else, it is cheap, modern semiconductor memory that has revolutionised computers.

    "content": "<p>A NOTABLE APPLE TREE</p>\n<p>What is probably the oldest apple tree in Victoria, an illustration of which is given is now in full bearing in the orchard of Mr. Bosch, near Greensborough. The tree was one of two purchased from Mr John Batman, and planted in 1838 by Mr. Flintoff. The particular variety not being known it was called Whatmough's Fancy, Mr.Whatmough being the occupier of the Orchard at that time. Some 20 years ago the tree was cut back and grafted with the Rhymer variety of apple. It is now laden with fruit, and is expected to yield from 25 to 30 bushels, not withstanding that one Large limb (which can be seen in the pic-ure) has been broken off by the weight of fruit. In 1851 the tree yielded 42 bushels. Mr. Bosh purposes cutting the tree back this year and grafting it with Rome Beauty, and hopes to considerably lengthen the life of the tree. On the right of the picture is Mr. Whatmough, a son of the first occupier of the orchard, and who was born in Flinders lane in a tent in 1842. The other two are Mr. Bosch and Mr. George Mitchell.</p>\n<p>This story was transcribed from <em>The Leader</em> newspaper, 9th April, 1910, p. 25.</p>",

    "content": "<p>An extract from 'A Harvest of Wax Fruit', published in 'Early American Crafts &amp; Hobbies', by R.F. &amp; M.W. Yates (New York, 1954):</p>\n<p>Wax fruit was cast in plaster-of-Paris moulds. When you learn how to cast an orange or an apple, you can cast any fruit - lemons, cucumbers, or bananas. We will use an orange as an example.</p>\n<p>The first venture requires very little material, all of it inexpensive and readily available. A pound package of plaster of Paris, a strip of tin about 3 inches wide. This tin is to be bent in to a ring with a diameter great enough to leave 1 inch of space between it and the orange when it encircles it, plus a slight allowance for overlapping at the ends.</p>\n<p>These, with a coffee tin, three small marbles, a ruler, piece of string, large spoon, paint brush, some fine sand (the cleaner and finer the better), wax, and colouring matter.</p>\n<p>Fill the coffee tin with moistened sand and level off the excess. Then press the orange down into the sand (stem up) until a little less than half of it is immersed in the sand. Pressing down the orange will, of coarse displace some of the wet sand. This excess sand around the 'equator' should be carefully leveled off a second time with a ruler edge.</p>\n<p>Ready now to use the strip of tin, you bend it into a ring of such diameter that when it is placed over the orange there will be about an inch of space between the orange and the inside of the ring. Since you may be using this strip of tin again and again, you needn't solder the joint for the ring, simply overlap the strip at the outside of the ring and fasten with string wound tightly and tied. Before actually inserting the ring, press the three small marbles half-way down into the moist sand around the orange; they should be set at equal distant intervals, half the distance between the orange and the eventual position of the ring. The marbles play an important&nbsp; part. This plaster of Paris mold for the orange will be in two parts, and you are now making the first half. It is imperative that both halves of the mold come together perfectly; that is, they must line up. The marbles are put in place so that the first half will have three depressions left in it to guide you in making a two-piece mold that will fit together.</p>\n<p>Next, the tin ring is slipped over the orange and the marbles and is pressed down into the sand until only half an inch of the rim is exposed above the orange. The mold set-up is now ready for pouring the plaster. In preparing and pouring it you must work rapidly. Clean water is added to a few ounces of plaster until it has a creamy consistency. If the amount is insufficient, you can quickly prepare more. Gently pour the mixture over the orange until the tin ring is filled to the top, completely covering the orange. Let the work stand until the plaster of Paris hardens enough so that a slight impression can be made with the finger. This requires only a few minutes.</p>\n<p>Lift the whole thing out of the sand: ring, orange and marbles. Cut the string and remove the plaster casting from the ring. The orange and marbles embedded in the mold can be easily removed and you have a perfect cast of marbles and orange. Some sand will cling to the plaster; it should be lightly brushed away. The surface to which the sand adhered can also be smoothed up with a knife if neccesary. The plaster should still not be too hard to prevent doing this.</p>\n<p>Preparation of the second half of the mold is much easier. Put the orange back into the first half of the mold as close as possible to its original position. Then, using a small brush, paint the edges of the first half of the mold, including the holes made by the marbles, with melted tallow or wax. This prevents the fresh plaster from adhering to it.</p>\n<p>With the stem end down, tightly encircle the orange with the tin strip and tie it firmly with a string. Pour the plaster over the orange as before. After it has hardened, insert the blade of a knife in the joint and separate the two parts, again removing the orange. The mold is now ready for use.</p>\n<p>The wax itself may be ordinary paraffin, old candles, almost anything. However, take precaution of melting the wax, whatever it may be, in a double boiler, or a serious fire may result. For fruit of a solid colour such as oranges and lemons, the wax is coloured before casting is made. Add a little turpentine to any of the colours ground in oil in a pan and pour the mixture into this while it is molten. Thorough stirring distributes the colouring matter uniformly through out the wax. Colours may be mixed in the ordinary way. It might be useful to melt a bit of wax and to mix various colours into it before you actually cast the fruit. You may be surprised by the little amount of wax needed. </p>\n<p>Now for the actual casting. Since it is hollow, very little wax is needed, about half an average candle will do. Preheat the mold before you begin casting. It should be left in very hot water for ten minutes to make sure that the heat has permeated through it. Thus, you prevent the wax from sticking to the surface when the orange is cast.</p>\n<p>While the mold is being heated, you can melt the wax in the double boiler and stir in the colour. The wax should be warm enough to ensure sufficient fluidity. Then, remove the mold from the hot water and carefully pat (not wipe) it dry with a clean cheesecloth or other absorbent fabric. Any attempt to wipe the mold dry inside will tend to destroy the natural irregularities of the orange cast into the surface of the plaster. Holding half of the still-hot mold in one hand, fill it three-quarters full of hot wax. </p>\n<p><strong>Reference</strong><br>'Delicious Deception: Wax Parlor Art in Nineteenth-Century America'. <em>Gastronomica.</em> Winter 2004, Vol. 4, No. 1, pp.10-12.

    "content": "<p>Ernesto Angerame was born on 7 March 1920 in Viggiano, a province of Potenza, in the region of Basilicata, Italy. He migrated to Australia in 1937 on board the ship <em>Remo</em>, leaving from Naples on December 1937, arriving at Station Pier, Port Melbourne on 16 January, 1938. </p>\n<p>In Italy, Ernesto was working for the local office of the Revenue Department. He did not want to come to Australia, but his mother asked him to take the place of a brother who at the last minute had changed his mind. He was sponsored by his brother Giovanni who had arrived in Australia in 1927 at the age of 16. Giovanni had learned the trade of barber on board the ship that took him to Australia and opened a barber shop in Melbourne. Soon after his arrival in 1938, Ernesto began an apprenticeship in his brother's barber shop. Many customers were Italian migrants who lived in Carlton, Fitzroy, Brunswick and North Melbourne. </p>\n<p>Ernesto was not naturalised, when Italy entered into World War II (10 June, 1940), as only those who had been in the country for a minimum of 5 years could apply for naturalisation. So in 1942, Ernesto and his brother were conscripted into the Civil Alien Corps to cut wood for the Forest Commission in Yea to help with the war effort. After 12 months in Yea he was sent to Myrtleford and from there to Ballarat. He served in this Corps for three years, although his brother was released earlier. The majority of the men cutting wood in the Civil Alien Corp in Australia were Italians. These men were well treated and paid a salary similar to that paid to the POWs. Once a month they were allowed to go home to see their families and stock up on personal needs. During the 1940s there were many Italian migrants in Myrtleford involved with tobacco growing. </p>\n<p>When he was released in 1945, Ernesto went to work for an Australian barber in Collins Street, opposite the Australia Hotel. He then ran a barber shop in East Brunswick for a year. In 1949 he opened his own shop at 330 Lygon Street, Carlton, where he worked for 35 years, until retirement in 1984. In the early 1950s the shop was renamed the 'Sportsmen's Saloon'. Amongst his customers were many Italian visiting boxers, international and national cyclists, local cyclists and soccer players of the Juventus Soccer Club, as well as footballers. Ernesto was also the official barber of the Carlton Football Club for many years. </p>\n<p>In the shop Ernesto also sold tobacconist and hair care products and Italian playing cards, such as the Napoletane. These cards were and still are quite popular in Italy for playing traditional games in cafe bars, games such as scopa, tresette, briscola and settebello. These games were a popular form of entertainment and gambling amongst Italian migrant men in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s and were played in the Italian caf&#233;s of Carlton and of other suburbs of Melbourne where Italians settled. </p>\n<p>In 1947, Ernesto was naturalised. The same year he married Giuseppina Toce at St George's Church (Sacred Heart) in Rathdowne Street, Carlton. Giuseppina had arrived in Melbourne with her parents on the <em>Remo </em>on 1 January 1939. Her family was from Gromento Nova, a town close to Ernesto's birth town of Viggiano. After opening his shop in Carlton, Ernesto became an active member of the Melbourne Italian community. He was one of the founding members of the Juventus Soccer Club, and for many years he was a member of the executive committee and president of Italy's oldest club, the Cavour Club. He was also a fundraiser for the Royal Melbourne Children's Hospital.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Doug Howden did his apprenticeship as an instrument technician with Australian Paper Mills and gained experience working with a number of other firms over several years. Doug was responsible for the instruments that controlled machinery, particularly boilers. Doug explains: &quot;<em>You have to control the machinery and you have to control it automatically without too much intervention from people. So you want to control your boiler pressure, you have a pressure sensor, a pressure transmitter, it goes to a pressure controller and it compares the pressure that you have with the desired pressure, then it'll actually send a signal off to your fuel valves, air valves and so forth.</em>&quot; </p>\n<p>Doug was familiar with Kodak Australasia's Coburg plant, having worked there as a contractor during the annual shutdown, when extra technicians were brought in to augment Kodak's regular maintenance team. Doug was impressed with Kodak's factory, which was well maintained compared with some other factories he had seen. This influenced Doug in his decision to apply for a job at Kodak in 1984. </p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<p>Doug commenced work as part of the maintenance team in the instrument workshop. This was one of several trade workshops in Building 12, the maintenance and construction centre for Kodak's Coburg plant. Having a background in steam, Doug's particular area of responsibility was the powerhouse. He was soon promoted to a leading hand, becoming the instrument foreman a few years later. </p>\n<p>Kodak's technical staff took a pride in way they maintained the plant and machinery in good working order. Doug remembers that this involved teamwork between the trades, particularly during the annual factory shutdown when the machinery was overhauled and new plant installed: &quot;<em>You all had your own part to play. And there was a bit of a competition about who was in front. Were we in front of the plumbers, were the plumbers in front of us? The electricians were waiting for everybody. It was good natured. We had a plumbing foreman there called Peter Oakley who had been a Collingwood footballer in the early league. He created a bit of this atmosphere and he'd say, 'How are you going?' I was the instrument foreman and he was the plumbing foreman, so he's putting the pipework in, I put the valves in.</em>&quot; </p>\n<p>Doug was part of the team that upgraded the coating track used to make colour film in the 1990s. Making colour film involved coating a base material with layers of light sensitive silver halide emulsion, using a draw-down system to bring the emulsions to the track via hoppers. Doug worked on the control panels, switches and meters that controlled the rate of flow and the temperature of the emulsions. It was vital that the emulsions were heated and cooled at the correct temperature gradient, determined by Kodak's chemical engineers, to ensure that the product met quality standards. This control required the skill of the instrument technician, which was more than 'simply switching things on and off'. </p>\n<p>Kodak's tradition of maintaining and building its own plant was to change from the late 1980s, when the central workshops were closed and contractors brought in to do large maintenance and installation works. Doug moved to the coating track as a shift engineer, a job that involved understanding the equipment and the interface between its components. If there was a breakdown he knew which tradesman to call, or in some cases, find the solution himself. </p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<p>As shift engineer Doug was still assigned to the powerhouse, ready to fix any problems that cropped up there. On one occasion he was called on to solve a major problem at the powerhouse, and remained for ten years, becoming powerhouse manager in 2003. The powerhouse (Building 11) was one of the first buildings constructed on the Coburg site, and was central to the factory's workings. It generated steam used for process heating, power for the factory, refrigeration for air conditioning, compressed air and various grades of water used in Kodak operations. Doug had a particular fondness for the powerhouse: &quot;<em>It was state of the art, it was good quality. One of the advantages about working with high pressure plant is that it's always good stuff. You can't afford for it not to be. Generally people don't want to go near the powerhouse because it's a big aggressive thing, it makes a lot of noise. But because everything is high pressure, it's really well made, really well designed and generally a pleasure to work on, and doesn't break down all the time. It is the heart of the place. I think when people are talking about an office system, they'll use industrial terms, and say, 'This is the engine room of the business'. That is the engine room. I was brought up with it from the time I was sixteen, so it was second nature to me.</em>&quot; </p>\n<p>Kodak's downsizing resulted in the integration of operations and maintenance in the powerhouse. Consequently the engine drivers were trained in trades and the tradesmen, including Doug, did their engine drivers certificate. After the Kodak factory closed in 2004, Doug stayed on to run the powerhouse and provide steam for the remaining operations as the complex was dismantled. One of the last buildings to be demolished was the powerhouse: &quot;<em>We were watching the stuff that we looked after for years being dismantled and sent to scrap. That was a bit strange. And when we shut down and cut the things up those boilers were perfect. So after all of those years, they were well looked after.</em>&quot; </p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<p>After his employment at Kodak finished in 2005, Doug worked as an engine driver in a refrigeration plant. He thought the working conditions were 'third world country sort of stuff', compared with Kodak: 'We used to call it 'Mother Kodak', and you were looked after.'. </p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<p>Whinney, Daryl, R.

    "content": "<h3> </h3>\n<p>Peter Hunter was born in England, where he commenced his career in photography as an apprentice in the Technicolor motion picture laboratory in the 1950s. He fulfilled his obligatory national service in the Royal Air Force, where he was photographer, after which he took a job at Kodak Limited. He commenced employment at their English headquarters in Kingsway London in 1959 as a technical author. The first instruction sheet he wrote was for the new Kodachrome 2 film. </p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<p>In 1961 Peter and his wife decided to take advantage of Australia's assisted immigration scheme, which provided cheap passage for British migrants: &quot;<em>We were called ten pound Poms. ... We had two kids and they travelled free. And when I came to Melbourne I went straight to Kodak, their Abbotsford offices at that time. Kodak Australia had a sort of policy almost that anyone who came from Kodak in England, they would find them a job somewhere.</em>&quot; </p>\n<h3></h3>\n<p>Peter was given the job of sales service manager in the marketing division, which was essentially an educative role for the public. Peter's responsibilities included writing technical leaflets and running the Kodak lecture service. The lectures were on motion picture films or recorded on audio tape with sets of illustrative slides. They were initially made by Eastman Kodak in America, but Peter re-wrote some of them for Australian consumers and recorded them at a radio station with professional radio announcers reading them. The lectures were available for loan to schools and camera clubs all over Australia. This was a good public relations program, as Peter comments: &quot;<em>I suppose Kodak had a policy of, if you can teach people to take better photos they'll enjoy it more and they'll buy more film.</em>&quot; </p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<p>Part of Peter's job was to set up and edit a new staff newspaper, which was called Australian Kodakery. It emulated Kodakery, the newsletter published by Eastman Kodak at its headquarters in Rochester, USA. The first issue of Australian Kodakery appeared in July 1968 and the newsletter ran until June 1985 when it was succeeded by Kodak News. </p>\n<p>Australian Kodakery commenced with four pages, typed up by Peter's secretary on an IBM Selectric typewriter, which had the advantage of several different typefaces. The pages were laid out with a physical cut and paste. About two thousand copies were printed and distributed to employees in all the branches around Australia and also to Coburg residents. Peter was able to use some of his other writing as copy for the newsletter: &quot;<em>I wrote a lot of press releases on new products and some of those just simply became articles for the newsletter. So when we brought out a new film, for example, we would describe it and I would go out with a camera somewhere and take some photos that ended up in print. It was only in black and white in those days, because making anything in colour in print was an expensive business. We had Kodakery correspondents in each department and in all the different branches and we got some interesting stories. Not always associated with the work, but someone who might have been a good sportsman or won a competition, and there would be pictures of him or her, and there would be an article, just to make people feel part of the big family.</em>&quot; </p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<p>Peter was the Kodak representative at photography conventions run by the Australian Photographic Society, which had a membership of about two thousand photographers, mostly amateur. Peter, who was nicknamed 'Mr Kodak', often gave a talk, and would organise a guest keynote speaker from overseas. He remembers one particular guest:&nbsp;&quot;<em>Richard Underwood who was the chief photographer for NASA at the time of the moon landings, and he had some fantastic photos and knew each of the astronauts personally.</em>&quot; </p>\n<p>By the mid 1980s Peter's role had expanded and he now headed a team called the Photo Information Services Group which provided advice and support to photographers. Team members would answer queries, speak at camera clubs, judge photographic competitions, write photo journal articles and Kodak leaflets, and run guided tours of the Kodak factory for the public. Peter set up a small museum at the Coburg plant. He collected old Kodak cameras and any memorabilia people donated, and set up display cases in the canteen and the reception area of the administration building. The Kodak museum's collection was acquired by Museum Victoria after the Coburg plant closed in 2004. </p>\n<p>Peter was also active in the staff camera club, which met regularly in the amenities building. He was president for a couple of years and became a life member. He remained a member of the club after he retired in 1995. He was awarded the Order of Australia Medal in 1990 for his services to photography, citing especially teaching photography to a group of disabled people in Yooralla. </p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<p>Beale, Nigel, 'The History of Kodak in Australia', 1983. </p>\n<p>Oral History: Peter Hunter, interviewed by Lesley Alves 20 February 2014 and unrecorded phone interview 6 November 2014.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Shane Allan did not have a particular career in mind when he joined Kodak Australasia as a casual shift-worker processing films during the 1965 Christmas rush at Kodak's Abbotsford plant. His sister, who was secretary to the manager of the photo finishing department, told him about the job. When the job finished Shane accepted a permanent position as a production planner at Kodak's new Coburg plant, and remained with the company for 37 years. </p>\n<p>The job involved a monthly warehouse stocktake for graphic arts and X-ray film products, and estimating the materials and labour requirements for the following month's production schedules. In 1966 Shane was called up for National Service. He was posted to Malaya where, because of his warehouse experience, he worked in the quartermaster-store. After he was de-mobbed, Shane returned to his former job at Kodak, where he planned Kodak's Camera Reels and Sundries products as well as Paper Products. </p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<p>The company suggested manufacturing as the next step for Shane, but he wanted to move to Brisbane, where he had spent some of his childhood. His transfer to Kodak's Brisbane branch was approved in 1975. </p>\n<p>Like other branches of Kodak Australasia, the Brisbane branch ran photo finishing operations and distributed Kodak's imported and Melbourne-made products. It was run fairly autonomously by a regional manager. Shane was in junior management, but he found that the hierarchy was strictly observed when he addressed the regional manager by his first name on the first morning of the new job: &quot;<em>The manager came through the warehouse and I said 'Oh, good morning Gordon'. 'Good morning Shane'. And we had a chat. Then about 15 minutes later the phone rang and the supervisor was called upstairs. And he said, 'At work, you've got to call him Mr ...'.</em>&quot; </p>\n<p>Shane helped to implement procedures for use of computer screens as opposed to writing coding sheets for data entry. Writing manuals and training staff for using the computer terminals. He also visited the Rockhampton and Townsville stores to oversee their warehouse stocktaking. </p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<p>In 1977 Shane was asked to move back to Melbourne to take charge of Kodak's stocktaking operations nationally. This offered him career prospects that he did not have in Queensland, where the next move would be into sales: &quot;<em>I didn't really want to get a car and drive around doing sales work</em>&quot;. </p>\n<p>Back in Melbourne, in 1980 Shane managed the amalgamation of Kodak's warehouses in Fawkner and Thomastown, Fitzroy, Richmond and Building 6 at Coburg into the new high-rise Distribution Centre in Newlands Road, (Building 21). The high-rise facility posed new problems for stock control, so Shane engaged consultants to help work up a cyclical stocktake method, even taking out a crane licence so that he could accesses all locations to do physical comparisons with computer records. </p>\n<p>Shane and his team in the equipment store (Building 6) also streamlined the order, delivery, installation and billing process for large products such as radiography and X-Ray processing equipment, photo-finishing printers, audio-visual products, micro-filmers and micro-film readers. This improved service for customers in the expensive equipment range. In 1986 Shane moved to the Business Imaging Systems Division as Customer Service Manager, looking after planning, products and customer contact for microfilm, microfilm readers, scanners and other equipment used for storing records of large organisations. The division's office was in Fitzroy Street St Kilda, close to business customers. </p>\n<p>Returning to Building 8 in Coburg in 1990, Shane became the customer service manager for three divisions: Printer Products, Copier Division and Business Imaging Systems. &quot;<em>That was a fun time from '86 to'91. We had a few years of twenty per cent growth, had some nice sales conferences as a result. I wasn't actually out selling things but I did have contact with customers. When we had trade shows in Melbourne or Sydney, I'd go with the team and help them. They were fun. Bit of hard work too, on your feet all day.</em>&quot; </p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<p>Shane moved to government price co-ordinating in 1992, taking on responsibility for tendering for government contracts in information technology systems. Kodak first had to qualify for the Government Information Technology Contract (GITC), which gave the company the right to tender. Kodak's government customers included federal and state departments and municipal councils Australia-wide. The role became redundant when Kodak made each department responsible for their own government tenders. </p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<p>Shane then became the company ombudsman in 1997, handling unresolved complaints for customers. He was able to resolve the vast majority of cases: &quot;<em>I think all of my experience up till then in dealing with customers and the training I'd had over the years, enabled me to do that job. You'd get a call, or you'd have a complaint, someone crying in your ear&nbsp;- all sorts of different things from lost films, to one of our stores being rude to someone, or a camera that didn't work and no one would listen to them about it. It was a very challenging job, you went in each day to work not knowing, when you picked the phone up, what was going to be on the other end of it. But that only lasted two and a half, three years. Then they disbanded that job and put it back to all the divisions, so they all had to handle all of their own problems.</em>&quot; </p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<p>In 2000 a job was found for Shane in Accounts Receivable, 'which was a breeze after the ombudsman's job'. He looked after a group of customers, including photofinishers and chemists, following up outstanding accounts and working out payment plans where necessary. Kodak's business was shrinking, mainly due to the advent of digital technology, and jobs were being shed. Shane accepted a package in January 2002. He worked part-time in an accounts receivable job with the Eastman Software Division, which had been sold off from Kodak, and later took on another part-time job with a former boss, Ron Gordon. He retired in 2010. </p>\n<h3> </h3>\n<p>Beale, Nigel, 'The History of Kodak in Australia', 1983 </p>\n<p>Whinney, Daryl, R.

There is also a significant number of images taken by Campbell on his various field trips around Australia with groups such as the Ornithologists Union, Victorian Field Naturalists, The Working Men's College Photographic Club and his family. </p>\n<p>The collection came into Museum Victoria's care on 22 December 1915 and forms part of a much larger holding which includes 1,884 specimens and an archive of letters, manuscripts, notes and sketches. In&nbsp;the early 1990s this collection was separated into two. The archival material most generally related to Campbell's ornithological and the specimens remained in the Ornithology Department and the other images and glass negatives were retrieved from the strong room under the stair in McCoy Hall and registered into the History and Technology Collection. Later in 2006 more albums were discovered in the Museum Library and transfered into the History and Technology collection. </p>\n<p>The History and Technology collection breaks down as follows:</p>\n<p>518 - Album photographs </p>\n<p>1486 - Glass negatives</p>\n<p>756 - Photographs</p>\n<p>1 - Printers Block<br></p>\n<p>In 1954 A.J's son AG Campbell died and left a large amount of material to the Museum. This material is also held by Museum Victoria - see Ornithology Department.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Transcribed from <em>The Age</em>, 24th November, 1887</p>\n<p>THE FIELD NATURALISTS AT KING'S ISLAND</p>\n<p>The party which, under the auspices of the Field Naturalists' Society, started from Port Melbourne for King's Island on the 2nd inst., for the purposes of exploring one of the smaller members of the group which once, according to the writher in the Cornhill Magazine, were all united to Southern Asia, from which they have been disallowed by mighty convulsions of nature, tearing Java, Sumatra, New Guinea and Australia asunder and separating all from the present mainland, returned to Melbourne on Monday evening. The theory of the Cornhill Magazine writer, which is not only plausible but logical, rests mainly on the remains of Asian animals found on the islands above referred to, the main object to arrive at tis an approximation to the period about which these catastrophes, one of which is of recent date occurred. The trip of the Field Naturalist, although not conclusively setting the matter, adds another link to the chain wrought by former inquirers and which may eventually connect Bengal and Timbuctu with the snowy mountain ridges of Switzerland, in whose caverns the bones of tigers, rhinoceroses and other tropical fauna have been found.</p>\n<p>The party, after landing from the steamer Lady Loch, first pitched their camp at Yellow Rock rivulet, whence they made excursions to collect specimens and explore the country. The Yellow Rock Creek, whence the fresh water is derived is brown in colour but sweet, and so on the sandy beach, not far from the camp , lies the wreak of the Ocean Bride. The weather was stormy and rainy at the outset by afterwards improved, until it became all that could be desired. The herbage was found to be luxuriant, trefoil and lucerne growing in abundance, but weeds, and especially the poisonous tares were rank. Hundreds of acres of spear grass were met with growing to a height of 3 feet, and so dense that it was almost impossible to walk through it. Very little timber of any size is to be found on the east coast, but down at the south end of the island some large trees were seen. In the centre of the island there are new large tracts of nice open country, and running streams of food water. Several attempts have been made to utilise the plain for pastoral purposes, but each has proved a failure. The sheep which have been recently tried were merinos, whilst the pasture is more suited to long wool. Cattle fatten well but young calves are difficult to rear. Horses and pigs do remarkably well. The latter have been allowed to wander to large, and now herds of them are roaming in several parts of the island. Some of the old boars near Wickham are said to weight over 4 oz. When pork ore bacon is required by the inhabitants the medium sized pigs are caught and sty fed for about eight weeks to correct the flavour acquired from the rotten kelp on which the feed in a sealed state. In some places scrub is so dense as to compel travellers to follow the beach, and all around the island the shore was found to be littered with remains of wrecked vassals. Several human bones, supposes to have drifted ashore from the French convict ship Nova, wreaked about 40 years ago, were found by a member of the party. The population of the island was found to be easily counted, being composed of four hunters and the lighthouse keepers, and their assistants, although 11 males, 7 females, 21 children. Most of these children were born on the place, and neither parent nor children had seen a doctor until the appearance of Dr. Llewellyn with the party. The Currie Harbour and Cape Wickham lighthouses were found to be in a most satisfactory condition. The water at the Currie Harbour jetty is 7 feet deep, and the anchorage 8 feet 6 inches at low water. </p>\n<p>Having said so much about the island, reference must be made to the objects of the clubs visit. The animals found most numerous were brush kangaroos and fur wallabies, tiger cats, larger than the Victorian ones, being plentiful, and requiring the inhabitants to watch their poultry very closely, as one of those animals killed 25 fowls at Currie Harbour in a single evening. The little native cats and native bears found in Victoria are absent, as are also the larger kinds of kangaroo. Two varieties of opossums are found, the ring tail and brush tail, the former having a black face. A very pretty furred rat and also field mice with long fur were found, but the snakes prevent them multiplying very fast. Of the birds many of the water foul are said to closely resemble Victorian kinds through the magpie, laughing jackass and emus were nowhere seen. The Tasmanian sooty crow shrike was very plentiful all along the coast where they share with gulls and water fowl and insects amongst, the rotten kelp. The pretty hooded dottrell seldom seen in Victoria existed in large numbers along the beach. None of the Victorian parrots were seen on the island, though three kinds our cockatoos were found -  the gang an, sulphured crested and black. Three kinds of robins were found - the dusky, the flame breasted and the rose breasted, all fairly numerous. The honey eaters seen were nearly all of Tasmanian origin, the wattle bird, with pendulous wattles over an inch long, is much larger than the Victorian. Six or seven of the smaller kinds were found. But only the New Holland and spine bill honey eaters resemble the Victorian. The sea eagle, eaglehawks, and six kinds of hawks are similar to their Victorian congeners. The Tasmanian lory is plentiful in parts. The superb warbler is much brighter that the Victorian, and has more colour especially the male bird. Two varieties of plover were found the spurning being a Tasmanian. A large collection was made of small birds.</p>\n<p>Reptiles were very numerous and in great variety. Six kinds of snakes were seen and specimens of most were taken alive, lizards were plentiful. The large cyclodus and many small ones have been secured. A large collection of sponges, comprising thirty kinds were formed and about 100 sorts of shells were picked up along the beach. The botanical collection, classified by Mr. M'Kibbon, is most valuable and extensive, embracing the flora of a coast line of over 45 miles and 8 miles inland. Some beautiful members of orchids were taken amongst other being Pterostylis curts, P. barbata, Caladinia, latitolia, C. Menziesli, C. carnes, C. alats, Thelymiltra, longifolia (form white), Corysanthus, fimbritata, cryptosylis longifolis, Sprengelia incarnata, Bankisa marginate, Comersperma valubile, Geranium Australe, Correa speciosa, Schizaea bifida, Ophioglossum vuigatum, Acaria Lougitolia &amp;c. as this section is very large, a more complete report cannot be given until plants have been submitted to Baron Von Mueller, the patron of the club for examination.</p>\n<p>With regard to the geology of the island but little was done in the way of investigation, the most noticeable outer crop under the sandy beach extending far inland being granite, forming in places cliffs of considerable height. No fossils were obtained, and in only one part was anything like limestone found, apparently the deposit of water trickling from above the collection of live stock made by the party is as follows; one Bennett's Kangaroo, 2 wallabies, 10 snakes, 2 pied oyster catchers, 5 young silver gulls, 1 Tasmanian crow shrike, 4 blue tongued lizards, and a variety of smaller ones and 4 echidnas. The other kinds noted or obtained were- White bellied sea eagles, spotted owl, white owl, three kinds of swallow, sacred kingfisher, allied diamond bird, Tasmanian graucuius, olivaceous thickhead, Tasmanian fantail, Selby's shrike thrush, three kinds of cuckoo, yellow bellied parakeet, rufous headed grass warbler, sombre coloured sericornis, Tasmanian acanthiser, ground lark or Australian pipet, six varieties of honey eaters, grey bucked zosterops, Caspian tern and Bass Strait tern.</p>\n<p>One of the features of the visit was a wallaby hunt which afforded good sport. Among the excursions made while on the island was one by a party consisting of Messrs. Campbell, Chandler, Cornwall, Chisholm, Frost, le Souef, Sayer, Wood, Professor Spencer and others to the east coast, with a hunt names Graves, as guide. They started on Monday the 7th and after travelling 20 miles pitched ten at Bertie's camp for the night. On the following day Spencer River, 17 miles distant on Sea Elephant Bay, was reached. Very little collecting was done, as the weather was bad, and the country bare of results. On Wednesday Mr. Wood assistant to Mr. Hart, photographer, took photos of several places of interest. Here a Blackwood forest and also one of blue gum were passed through by very little animal life was seen. Professor Spencer and Mr. La Souef visited a place called 'The Wall' but found nothing of interest. The former took sketches of the scenery. Five echidnas were taken alive, but one subsequently escaped. As provisions ran short a return journey was commenced. On Thursday Bertie's camp was made where two of the party remained collection. On Friday 11th, Cape Graves hut on the way, and the whole party hospitably entertained by Mr. Garraway, the lighthouse keeper. On Saturday the party returned to the main camp at Yellow Rock.</p>\n<p>The second party consisting of Messrs Dixson, Dombrian, Hatton, Hughes, Keartland and M'Kibbon left for Currie Harbour at 9 am on the 7th with hunter Henry Scott for a guide. After passing the wreck of the Ocean Bride a course was taken through the hills east of Whistler Point, the journey being a very rough one rain falling nearly all the way to Porky lagoon, where camp was pitched. On the way the hunter's dogs which accompanied the party killed several wallabies, so all had fresh meat for ten. A fairly good collection of various kinds was made on the road. Birds, animals birds eggs, shells, sponges and botanical specimens, &amp;c, added materially to the load. At Porky Lagoon plenty of good water was found, alter drying wet clothes and blankets all turned in thoroughly tired after 13 miles tramp over very rough country. On the way many miles had to be forced through a species of wild tobacco plant common in Tasmania. It grows just as freely in hills and valleys. On Tuesday, 8th a successful morning was spent around camp, and come of the best birds taken during the trip were secured. At 2pm another start was made for Currie Harbour, many nice fresh streams being passed on the way, and fine open country. Currie Harbour was reached at 5pm.&nbsp; Mr Buckpitt, the lighthouse keeper, soon made all things pleasant, and the evening was spent in a visit to the lighthouse, a preserving specimens. On Wednesday some of the party went to the Ettrick River, and on the way found the eggs of the Pacific gull, black and red oystercatchers, silver gull and hooded dotreil, besides securing some of the old bird. The others were taken tot some small islands in the harbour in a boat by Mr, Buckpitt and an assistant, and a few marine curios were found. Here the skins of several enormous tiger cats were obtained. On Thursday, the homeward march was commenced, with the assistance of an additional horse, supplied by Mr. Buckpitt, who accompanied the party a few miles on the way and camp was pitched at Porky Lagoon for the night. On resuming our march next morning the party had not preceded far when a fine porcupine was caught uninjured, and also a crow shrike which had probably been injured in a fight with another bird. One gentleman killed no fewer than six snakes in a many miles. After a pause for lunch at Pass River, camp was soon reached.</p>\n<p>A third party consisting of Messrs, Campbell, Jun, Coles, Deasey, Lan and Dr. Llewellyn made a trip to Whistler's Point, and made a good collection of sea fowl and marine productions. Mr Sweet directed dredging operations at Wickham, but the coast is bare of marine life. After 30 tries with the dredges only broken shells, some polyzoa and gasteropods were obtained. Several members of the different parties proceeded further south, where they say the remains of the wreck of the British Admiral, and found the anchor and several other portions which a recently washed ashore.&nbsp; The marble monument erected to the memory of Mr Nicholson son of the late Hon. Win Nicholson, who along with 78 others, perished in the wreck of the British Admiral, on 23rd may 1874 aged 25 years, is still standing, but the iron portion of the frame is nearly corroded through and the woodwork has completely disappeared. The tablet in memory of those were drowned in the Catarique is still standing, but so corroded as to render the inscription quite illegible. This might have been easily avoided, as the hunters on the island state that they would have given it a coat of tat on many occasions, if they could only get it left for them at the lighthouse.</p>\n<p>The last few days in camp were spent in shore excursions inland and in packing specimens. On Saturday evening 19th, the Lady Loch was soon off New Year Islands, where she lay all night. Early on Sunday morning Captain Anderson came ashore and desired all hand to strike camp at once, as the opportunity was favourable, and delay would be very inconvenient. During the afternoon tow parties visited New Year Islands, but found very little interest beyond one new fern and a few gulls' eggs. The mutton birds had commenced to burrow, but only a few had laid. On the east side of the north island cabbages, parsley and garden flowers, such as stocks are growing wild. At 4pm on the 21st inst a new start was made by the lady Loch from New Years Islands for Apollo Bay, where a party of gentlemen had been left on Saturday, amongst them being Mr. Wilson engineer of ports and harbours, Mr Steel, inspector-general of public for medical treatment. Messrs. Wilson and Steel had mad an inspection of Apollo Bay jetty, part of which recently blown way in a gale. Williamstown was reached at 8.45pm.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Transcribed from <em>The Daily Telegraph</em>, 22nd November, 1889</p>\n<p>KING'S ISLANDS</p>\n<p>FIELD NATURALIST EXPLORATIONS PARTY</p>\n<p>THE ISLAND TASMANIAN, NOT VICTORIAN</p>\n<p>Intelligent people are always anxious to acquire a knowledge concerning the product and natural features of the land they live in. It is man's duty to make the earth yield her best treasures, and in order to do so he must acquire knowledge of such recognised sciences a geology and botany. But it is also incumbent on man that he should study the birds, beast, fishes, reptiles and insects of his native land and its adjacent islands, and I make notes of their forms and habits. It is for this purpose that the Field Naturalists Society of Victoria was formed, and when it became known that the member had determined to explore the almost unknown regions of Kings Island, Bass Strait, the idea was received by very body in the community. The government came promptly to the aid of the party and placed a number of defence tents and the Lady Loch at their disposal, and on this 5th November they stated their journey returning at 10 o'clock last night. The following are a few hurriedly gathered notes of the expedition. </p>\n<p>'My Gallant crew, Good Morning'<br>'Now gentlemen' said Mr. A. J. Campbell, the captain of the party, 'answers to your names'. 'Aye, aye sir', was the response and the following 'happy hunters' answered to their names: E. Cornwell, (ornithologist),E. Chandwelle (ornithologist), Deasey and his dog Carlo, J.E Dixon (entomologist), A. J. Campbell and T. G. Campbell (colonists), Dr Lewellin (hospital staff), Charles Lane, Professor Spencer (biologist of the Melbourne University) Dudley Le Souef (Zoological and Acclimatisation Society), C. Frost and - Sheppart (ornithologist), W. Sayer (botanist of the late geographical expedition to New Guinea), F. N. Ingamella (Melbourne Observatory, Chisholm, Sweet, Ernest Dombrain (colonist),&nbsp; T. Wood (assistant to Mr Hart, photographer, lecture of photography at the Workings-men's College), Hughes, A. Cole (taxidermist, Elizabeth Melbourne), M' Kibbon (botanist), W. Hatton (colonist), J. Keartland (naturalist), H.W. Hunt (naturalist)- St John (collector for Mr Alexander Borthwick, jun), and Mons, Musika (cook and billy boiler).</p>\n<p><br>EAST COAST EXPLORATION <br><br>On Monday, the 7th inst, the following members set out on the first organised expedition to ascertain what the east coast line was like- Campbell, Le Souef, Cornwell, Chandwelle, Frost, Wood, Chisholm, Sayer and Professor Spencer. The excursion was a rough but pleasant one, and was fraught with good results. But the details of the journey are better told in the professors own word 'Yes you're right, we had a rough time of it, and my nose tells a tale, and has lost much of its natural beauty in battling with the elements'. Starting about 7 o'clock we trudged about six miles along the beach. We were accompanied by Henry Grave, who had extensive knowledge of the locality, having hunted the north and east of the island for last ten years. We struck the land again near camp No. 10. From this pint we made across the island, leaving away on our left a large lake, which named Lake Dobson, after the worthy member of the Legislative Council who did so much to make our trip a success. After travelling some miles in the pouring rain, we passed the Martha Lavina Lagoon, so called after a vessel which was wrecked on the coast close in the day south of Boulder Point. It was high tide, and we had to walk which was very tedious. After passing round Lavini's Point we reached Bertie's or No. 7 camp. The weather had been miserable, and the ground was very damp. Four of us slept in a rest preferred the tent we had brought with us, and which we erected. We had to cover the ground with ti-tree boughs or 'boles' on which we had to lie all night. We did no complain of the discomfort audibly, but we muttered curses deep if not loud, and in the morning our bones ached. Next morning we struck the coast again and walked on to Elephant River. The river runs through very flat country, and saves at its shallow estuary, is deep enough for boat traffic; but then no boat could cross the shallow bar into the river proper. There is no doubt that boats have been taken across to the river, which has been navigated for miles into the interior. We found any quantity of kangaroo and wallaby about this river. We were taken a Grave's pack-horse. Just to the south of the river were caught a rare bird called 'The Pacific tern' and got its nest and eggs. This is only place in the island where it exists. Skirting the beach for a few miles, and crossing a small rivulet, we reached No. 9, known as Eldorado Camp, on the shore of Sea Elephant Bay. In this spot we could see Elephant Island in the distance. This island is remarkable from being covered with rookeries of cormorant, gulls and mutton birds. From camp No. 9 we divided our party some proceeding inward to the Blackwood range, while some trudged on southwards past Fraser's River to the blue gum forests. It is a peculiar feature that Fraser's River divides two kinds of country. North the land undulates, and is covered with scrub and grass, while to the south the country is hilly and heavily timbered. </p>\n<p>Professor Spencer and Mr Le Soeuf pluckily went as far south as they could, but their progress was arrested after they had proceeded about four miles beyond a promontory (which they names Point Campbell) by what is known as the 'brick wall'. Here the cliffs come down vertically to the sea, and arrest all progress by the coast line, while the forest inland is impenetrable. Returning to camp the party re-assembled, and commenced a weary trudge homewards. The provisions of the party by this time were done, and there was no alternative but to turn to the bran, which they carried for the horses, on which to subsist. This they made into a mash and ate, and with an occasional dish of dried kangaroo tail soup, they got, they got on fairly well. Instead of returning to the headquarters camp, the party proceeded to Camp Wickham. Their last meal exhausted even the 'bran mash' which was carefully doled out to each member. It may be mentioned the on the first day after the east coast party set out, Mr Sayers, who had only recently returned from New Guinea, became very ill with fever and ague and remained at Bertie's camp in company with Mr Chisholm, who remained to nurse him. He ultimately reached camp in a very exhausted condition, where he was added to carefully by Dr. Lewellin. </p>\n<p><br>THE WEST COAST EXPLORERS<br><br>After a Sunday in camp, and a good rest, a second party was made up on the following Monday, the 14th inst., and a start was made to explore the west coast. They went by the coast to Whistler Point, and thence overland at time and at times along the shore proceeded to Pass River. This was yo to that time the only clear water stream come across in the island. Then a weary tramp overland to Porky River, a portion going inland to Porky hut, where they camped. The main body of the party walked through thick scrub to Currie Harbour. They stated, there all night and next day continue southwards. They soon came to British Admiral Bay, where the vassal of that name was wrecked on the 23rd May 1874. There any amount of wreckage was seen. Monuments erected to young Mr. Nicholson and to Tilly Dale, who were drowned out of that vessel, were also visited. The shore here is very rocky and long reefs stretch out to sea and the coast is very dangerous. During 21 years previous to the erecting of the lighthouse at Currie Harbour, 22 wreaks occurred, but none have occurred since. The party next reached Eterick River, when they fossicked a little. It was known that there were numbers of the ornithorhynchus or platypus in the river, but none were seen. Most of the explorers went a little further south till they reached the dripping wells, a most peculiar and interesting limestone's formation. At Fitzmaurice Bay a monument was fond erected in memory of 733 persons who perished in the Cataraque, which was lost there. Messrs; Frost, Chandler and Spencer proceeded further than the rest, and went round Cataraque Point, the most southern point reached being Seal Rock. There Chandler slept all nigh with hopes of catching a young seal. During the night a huge seal crept on to the rock, and uttered two or three roars, which took the stuffing out of the bold hunter, and picking you his gun he fled into the darkness of the night and reached the camp in the morning, haggard and dishevelled. The party then return leisurely to headquarter camp.</p>",

From 1929 until the early 1970s the Home's role was to care for babies awaiting adoption. From 1974, the direct care of neglected babies was phased out in favour of family unit-based support services. </p>\n<p>According to former nurses who worked at the Babies Home during World War II, tomato sauce bottles were used to feed the babies because babies' bottles were almost unobtainable. The babies were placed on their sides in their cots, and the filled bottle with a rubber teat covered with flannel was propped up on a chaff-filled cushion so that the baby could reach the milk. The nurse then moved onto the next baby.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The Waltons chain was established in 1953. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On 22 October 1964 Waltons opened 12 stores around Melbourne, including three department stores (City, Prahran and Brunswick) and nine 'Home Lovers' stores (including Footscray, Collingwood, Camberwell and Croydon), giving Waltons over 60 stores across the eastern states. A medal was issued to staff who worked on opening day of the Waltons store in Bourke Street, Melbourne (NU 42191). It expressed the appreciation of company principal J.R. Walton. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bourke Street (reported as the city's first new Department Store for 40 years) was the chain's flagship store in Victoria, costing over 3 million pounds to construct and boasting '53 different Departments'. It owed its overall design to the American retailer Sears Roebuck, who were in partnership with the Waltons family. It particularly marketed itself to young people, promoting itself to 'Young Melbourne' as 'a store you can call your own. A smart new place to meet - and eat - and shop for new trend setting styles from leading fashion houses, and the latest in transistors.' It also offered Waltons All Purpose Charge Account, 'ideal for young shoppers', as a way of delaying payment for merchandise with only a 'small accounting charge'.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The store was officially opened by the Lady Mayoress of Melbourne, Mrs E.L Curtis, who cut the ribbon to let in the thousands of eagar shoppers waiting to enter. The Chairman of Waltons, Mr J R Walton, reported that the day's trading far exceeded expectations, and that 'staff were taken out of our offices and put to work on the selling floors'. Even so, advertisements were taken in the next day's newspapers thanking customers for 'one of the greatest days in Melbourne shopping history' and for their 'patience and uncomplaining even though services were strained beyond capacity, and it was not possible to offer the prompt and efficient attention for which Waltons are famous.'</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Waltons traded until the late 1980s, a victim of the recession and bad management, having passed from the Waltons family to Alan Bond in 1981, then to the Venture Stores company. In 1985, during Alan Bond's ownership, the Bourke Street store was closed and the building sold off, eventually being demolished as the site of the new Village Cinema Complex.</p>",

They first appeared in Australia in the 1840s - 1850s. The Australian Natives' Association (ANA) was formed in Melbourne in 1871. Its focus was political. Composed of native-born Australians, it aimed to develop a direction for Australia that was independent of Britain, and to develop quality educational facilities for native Australians who appeared to be disadvantaged by a lack of British education. It was a vocal supporter of Federation. The ANA spread to all Australian states and eventually New Zealand. Its non-political activities came to include cultural events, personal sponsorships and support for the development of Australian football. Following Federation it adopted causes including national defence, the White Australia policy, railway expansion and nature conservation. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>References:<br></strong>Williams, Melvin, 'A Very Australian Friendly Society', NMAA Journal, 8, pp.59-64.</p>",

    "content": "<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross was formed in 1863 and is the founding body of the Red Cross movement. Today the Australian Red Cross is one of 178 members of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. </p>\n<p>The Australian Red Cross was formed as a branch of the British Red Cross at Government House, Melbourne on 13 August 1914. It was established by Lady Helen Munro-Ferguson, wife of the Governor-General, nine days after the outbreak of World War I. Lady Munro-Ferguson had been a member of the British Red Cross in Fyfe, Scotland, and was aware of the important role the organization played in Britain. She asked the wives of each State Governor to form a local committee in each capital, which they agreed to do.</p>\n<p>The first Australian Red Cross volunteers focused on supplying care parcels containing soap, toiletries, special food and games for sick and wounded troops. Within weeks of its foundation, the Branch was providing clothing (flannel shirts, cardigans, socks and gloves), medical supplies and equipment. Soon it was shipping items such as mosquito nets, hospital clothing and materials, and food parcels. It initiated the Voluntary Aid Detachments (VAD), whose members cared for the sick and wounded in hospitals, on trains during transport and in convalescent homes. The Red Cross provided assistance to the survivors of the Battle of Gallipoli, the soldiers who fought in Egypt, the blind and those suffering from the effects of war.</p>\n<p>In 1915 it also began its Transport Service, driving soldiers who had returned on the hospital ships to their homes or convalescent facilities. By the end of 1916 the Service included 2,500 cars, with more than half overseas, working on the battlefields of France, Italy and East Africa. Transport duties included&nbsp;daily ambulance rounds to hospitals, weekly outings with patients, and delivering and collecting materials. The Australian Red Cross also developed the Cycle and Motor Cycle Corps, with volunteers delivering special Red Cross messages or small parcels.</p>\n<p>After the Great War the Australian Red Cross continued to care for returned servicemen. The thousands of Australian Red Cross volunteers who had been engaged actively during the war effort remained involved through local services and programs which were expanded to include hospital visits, emergency and disaster assistance, transport and first aid training: all the while expanding the strength and professionalism of the volunteers and the capacity of Australian Red Cross. The sick and needy in the wider community were now also assisted. </p>\n<p>In 1929 Australian Red Cross set up the Blood Transfusion Service in Victoria, which soon expanded throughout Australia. Today the Australian Red Cross Blood Service is considered to be one of the most effective and safe blood services in the world.</p>\n<p>In the same year that the Blood Transfusion Service was established, the Second Geneva Convention stated that Red Cross volunteers could be deployed alongside official medical personnel of the armed forces in the task of searching for and evacuating wounded or killed soldiers, and in the prevention of disease in the armed forces.</p>\n<p>In 1938 the Australian Red Cross was formally recognized as an autonomous National Society, and was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1941. Its official name became The Australian Red Cross Society.</p>\n<p>World War II placed much bigger challenges on Red Cross Society volunteers and services: 347 men and 193 women served in 23 countries, as well as on hospital ships and aircraft carriers. Thousands of Australians spent hundreds of hours in Red Cross offices around the country, packing Red Cross parcels, sewing clothes and processing tracing requests. </p>\n<p>Volunteers worked in hospitals throughout Australia, and the Australian Red Cross also supplied all personnel except for doctors and nurses for civil emergency hospitals and first aid posts. They cooked meals, carried out immunization programs and organized blood donor drives. Australian Red Cross staff also provided assistance to captured and wounded enemy soldiers being treated in military hospitals.</p>\n<p>Providing weekly food parcels, clothing, medical and other supplies to Australian Prisoners-of-war was one of the main tasks of Australian Red Cross. For hundreds, if not thousands, the Red Cross parcels meant survival. Many POWs in Germany, Italy and other European countries received regular Red Cross deliveries. The Japanese Government refused to permit the dispatch of food parcels, medical supplies and clothing to POWs in the Far East, however.</p>\n<p>The scope of relief activities undertaken by Australian Red Cross during World War II was enormous. In 1945 Australian Red Cross chartered the Admiral Chase to ship supplies to Europe. </p>\n<p>The Red Cross Tracing and Message Service was one of the busiest services during World War II. Prisoners of War have a right to communicate with their families under the Geneva Conventions, and during 1943 alone some 230,000 letters were distributed to POW camps in Malaya, Java, Shanghai, Hong Kong, China, Burma and Japan.</p>\n<p>Australian Red Cross carried out a vast range of other relief operations throughout the war. In Egypt a surgical unit was established, and in Papua New Guinea an army hospital was set up in Torokina. </p>\n<p>The busiest time for the Transport Service was in 1945, when volunteer drivers met thousands of wounded servicemen and returning prisoners of war. </p>\n<p>In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the Australian Red Cross became active in providing emergency and development relief assistance to many countries. The need in many parts of the world was enormous. Disasters in Greece, Malaysia, Korea, Papua New Guinea, Pakistan and Japan were also assisted. </p>\n<p>After the 1950s, Australian Red Cross continued to expand its domestic and overseas humanitarian operations. During the Korean War, it provided services to Australian troops with volunteers visiting hospitals, facilitating correspondence with families at home and organizing help for released POWs. Provision of emergency relief assistance in disasters and conflicts, implementation of development programs and deployment of professional delegates all became standard activities of Australian Red Cross. </p>\n<p>The National Office of Australian Red Cross Society is today based in Melbourne. State and Territory Offices are located in each capital city and are responsible for membership, fundraising and the provision of local services and programs.</p>\n<p>Over 60 community services are provided in Australia, including Disaster and Community Services (such as Meals on Wheels), Tracing and Refugee Services, First Aid, Health and Safety Services and the Australian Red Cross Blood Service. Overseas, Australian Red Cross provides other development and emergency programs. At any given time, more than 50 medical and relief field staff bring assistance and relief to victims in war zones around the world.</p>\n<p><strong>References:<br></strong>Australian Red Cross website <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.au/aboutus_history_australia_default.htm\">http://www.redcross.org.au/aboutus_history_australia_default.htm</a></p>",

    "content": "<p>F &amp; W Stewart, Jewellers, was established at 147 Charles Street, Launceston, in 1879 by brothers Frederic and William Stewart. The Stewart brothers are considered Tasmania's first medallists. The business prospered, and was listed as a shareholder in the Princess River Gold Mining Company in 1887. In 1902 the brothers purchased a property at 100 Charles Street, where the business remains to this day, still in family hands. According to Roger McNeice, it was described as a 'palatial jewellery establishment' and one of the finest in Australia. </p>\n<p>The company struck 'quite a few' medallions and medalets for local events and exhibitions during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The issues are of importance because they cover five major events: the Launceston Industrial Exhibition of 1886-67, the Jubilee of Queen Victoria 1887, the Tasmanian exhibition of 1891-92, the Centenary of Launceston 1906 and the Australian Natives' Association Exhibition, Launceston, 1908. Of greater importance was the fact that the company was the first in Tasmania to import machinery and strike their own medals. </p>\n<p>The metal dies initially used in striking medals were prepared on site, but later dies were made in Melbourne by Thomas Stokes of Stokes and Martin. Striking continued to be undertaken in Launceston (although McNeice notes that the Centenary of Launceston Medal was struck in Melbourne by Stokes). </p>\n<p><strong>References:<br></strong>The Tasmanian Numismatist Internet Edition, 3, 4 April, 1988.<br>Rootsweb.com, viewed 12/9/2003<br>McNeice, Roger. <em>Historic Medals of Tasmania</em> (Vol.1.)

He founded his business at 3 Gregory Terrace, Brisbane, in 1896, producing medallions, medalets and uniform buttons and badges for the armed forces and Government departments. His work was of high quality, and he increased the business to produce a wide range of medallic products. The growing business moved to Lower George Street, Brisbane. Parkes retired in 1941, selling the business to Eric Faux, whose family still control the business today. The business moved back to Gregory Terrace, but remained there for only 11 years, moving to their current complex in Salisbury in 1961. </p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong><br>Carlisle, L.J.

    "content": "<p>In Australia, the decade from 1957 was generally dry with parts of Australia being affected to varying degrees. Eastern Australia experienced the greatest severity of reduced rainfall from 1965 to 1968. The first six months in 1967 were the driest January - June period for the 20th century over large areas of Victoria, south-eastern South Australia, and north-eastern Tasmania. Parts of south-western Victoria were declared drought areas as limited rain and extremely dry conditions continued from mid-September. Crops were depleted and large numbers of stock were moved from western Victoria to Gippsland and parts of NSW. In Melbourne, 1967 remains the driest year in 140 years of records. The drought lingered in Victoria until March 1968 when relief came from rains in late April and May. December 1968 experienced generally greater rainfall across the states which ended the drought. </p>\n<p>Seasonal conditions directly impacted upon changes in the national livestock market and resulted in fluctuating sales at Newmarket. Water conservation signage such as the one in the Newmarket Collection highlights an awareness of water conservation as drought conditions were experienced throughout the State of Victoria. </p>\n<p><strong>References:<br></strong><a href=\"http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/naturaldisasters/\">http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/naturaldisasters/</a></p>",

The Mint, however, did not have the ability to prepare dies from artwork, obtaining its coinage dies directly from London. The Mint's ability to even harden engraved dies was questionable. </p>\n<p>The first major piece to be issued by the mint was struck in 1859: a commemorative medal awarded to those who attempted to rescue survivors of the Admella shipwreck near Portland in Victoria. </p>\n<p>\n</p><h3>List of Deputy Masters of the Sydney Branch of the Royal Mint</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Captain Edward WolstanholmeWard ,1853-1868<br>Charles E Louis,1869-Jan 1878<br>Robert Hunt C.M.G., &nbsp;Jan 1878-Sep 1892<br>John McDonald Cameron, May 1893-Jan 1898<br>Edward Henry Silberstein von Arnheim, April 1898-Aug 1921<br>John Honeyford Campbell O.B.E.
